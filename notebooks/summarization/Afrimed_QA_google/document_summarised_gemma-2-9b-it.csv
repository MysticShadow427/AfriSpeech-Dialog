03:33:35","## Key Points from Doctor-Patient Conversation:

**Patient:** Peter, 45-year-old male

**Chief Complaint:** Sudden fainting spell earlier that day lasting a few minutes.

**Medical History:**

* Diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago, not always well-controlled.
* Father had a stroke at age 60.
* Currently takes Amlodipine for hypertension, but inconsistently.
* Smokes at least half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years.
* Occasionally drinks alcohol.

**Symptoms:**

* Fainting spell this morning, no warning signs.
* No chest pain, headache, palpitations, or shortness of breath.

**Other:**

* No history of surgery or recreational drug use.
* No known food or drug allergies.

**Next Steps:**

The doctor will likely perform a physical examination and order further tests to determine the cause of Peter's fainting spell. This may include blood work, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and possibly other imaging studies.


**Concerns:**

* Peter's inconsistent medication adherence for hypertension raises concerns about his blood pressure control.
* His smoking history and occasional alcohol consumption are additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
* The family history of stroke further increases his risk."

* **Sports hernia:** This is a tear in the abdominal wall muscles that support the groin area.



It's important to note that this is just a preliminary assessment based on the limited information available. A definitive diagnosis can only be made after a thorough physical examination, review of the investigation results, and possibly further tests."

She started vomiting undigested food recently but is no blood or bile on it. The condition is associated with severe nausea and weight loss. She doesn't have any history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain or headache. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago and her pregnancy test read positive. She has no history of similar symptoms in the previous pregnancy, neither does the condition occur when she's not pregnant. She hasn't done any surgery in the past and doesn't have any chronic illness. She also have no family history of similar illness. Mrs. Oge, according to her, does not smoke nor drink. She's not also in any prescription drugs, but she maintained that she started prenatal vitamins after she confirmed pregnant. She doesn't have any known food or drug allergies.

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:46:58
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:49:47
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

[Speaker 2]: Hello. My name is musa. I am 50 years old and i consent to the recording of this conversation 

00:23:59
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

00:01:1800:01:18","##  Summary of Doctor-Patient Conversation:
