Precious is conducting a consultation with Gift, who is visiting the hospital due to a fever that has persisted for two days. Gift is a 32-year-old farmer from the Igala tribe, living in a rural area in Kogi State, near a swampy region. She is married, has two children, and reports experiencing a high-grade constant fever, associated with chills, severe profuse sweating, generalized headache, body weakness, loss of appetite, and nausea, but no vomiting, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, convulsions, or seizures. Gift does not use insecticide-treated nets or insect repellents, lives in a malaria-endemic region, and has observed many people in her area getting malaria. She does not consume alcohol, smoke, or take any prescription drugs, and has no known allergies. Gift has not traveled recently, nor does she have a family history of conditions such as hypertension or diabetes. Precious suggests that malaria could be the cause of the symptoms, intends to conduct a physical examination and investigations to confirm the diagnosis, and plan appropriate treatment.",0.7412152290344238,0.7974423170089722,0.7683014273643494

[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

00:01:1800:01:18","The conversation is between Dr. Hadiza, a general medical practitioner, and a patient named Musa, who is 50 years old. Musa reports experiencing worsening rectal bleeding over the past two weeks, changes in bowel habits, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue. He has a controlled case of high blood pressure and no major history of surgeries or hospitalizations. Musa's father had colorectal cancer, and his mother has been in remission from breast cancer. He quit smoking ten years ago and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has no known allergies.

Dr. Hadiza discusses that the symptoms and Musa's family history raise concerns for colorectal cancer, though other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, polyps, hemorrhoids, or diverticulosis are possibilities. A colonoscopy and blood tests are recommended for diagnosis, with the colonoscopy involving the insertion of a flexible tube with a camera to examine the colon. If any concerning areas or polyps are found, biopsies will be taken. The conversation concludes with Musa feeling informed but nervous about the possibility of cancer, and Dr. Hadiza reassuring support and emphasizing the importance of early detection.",0.7830973863601685,0.8333621621131897,0.8074482679367065

[Speaker 1]: From my findings, Mrs. Oge, age 26, is having severe and persistent vomiting, which has lasted for 2 weeks now. She finds it difficult to keep down food or liquid. She started vomiting undigested food recently but is no blood or bile on it. The condition is associated with severe nausea and weight loss. She doesn't have any history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain or headache. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago and her pregnancy test read positive. She has no history of similar symptoms in the previous pregnancy, neither does the condition occur when she's not pregnant. She hasn't done any surgery in the past and doesn't have any chronic illness. She also have no family history of similar illness. Mrs. Oge, according to her, does not smoke nor drink. She's not also in any prescription drugs, but she maintained that she started prenatal vitamins after she confirmed pregnant. She doesn't have any known food or drug allergies.
05:59:07
","[TextBlock(text=""Here are the key points from the doctor-patient conversation:\n\n- The patient, Mrs. Oge, is a 26-year-old pregnant woman around 8 weeks into her pregnancy.\n\n- Her chief complaint is severe, persistent vomiting for the past 2 weeks where she is unable to keep down any food or liquids. Recently she has been vomiting undigested food.\n\n- Associated symptoms include severe nausea and weight loss.

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.
05:43:11
","[TextBlock(text=""Based on the conversation, the key points are:\n\n1. The patient, a 45-year-old female, has been experiencing frequent urination and excessive thirst for the past 2 weeks. The frequent urination is more pronounced at night, occurring 5-6 times before waking up.\n\n2. The patient also reports feeling unusually tired and has unintentionally lost about 2kg in weight during this period.\n\n3. There is no pain or burning sensation during urination, no vision problems, no numbness in hands or feet, no delayed wound healing, and no skin infections.\n\n4. The symptoms have been persistent, and increasing water intake did not alleviate the excessive thirst.\n\n5. The patient has no previous history of such symptoms or surgeries but has a family history of type 2 diabetes (her mother had it).\n\n6. The patient's lifestyle involves a sedentary job as an accountant, a diet high in fast food and snacks, and occasional alcohol consumption during special occasions.\n\n7.

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so thank you Kemi. Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:46:58
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:49:47
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:43:27
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:45:02
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

06:48:53

[Speaker 1]: you are welcome, Kemi. we'll get to the bottom of this together and make sure you are feeling better soon. take care.
","[TextBlock(text=""Based on the conversation, the key points are:\n\n1. The patient, Kemi Albert, a 35-year-old female, presented with pain, swelling, and gradual increase in size of the swelling in her left lower leg for the past two weeks. She also reported experiencing a high-grade fever, especially at night, and some tingling sensations in the affected leg.\n\n2. The pain was rated as 8 out of 10 in severity, and over-the-counter pain medications did not provide much relief.\n\n3. Kemi did not have any recent injuries or travel history, and her medical history was unremarkable, with no chronic diseases, surgeries, or family history of similar illnesses.\n\n4. The doctor inquired about Kemi's gynecological health, which was normal, with no abnormalities reported.\n\n5. Based on the symptoms and examination, the doctor suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the leg, which can cause pain, swelling, and fever, and potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if the clot breaks loose.\n\n6. The doctor planned to confirm the diagnosis with tests, such as an ultrasound of the leg, and check for signs of infection, such as cellulitis.\n\n7. In the meantime, the doctor prescribed medication to help with the pain and swelling.\n\nOverall, the conversation focused on gathering information about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and potential causes, leading to a suspected diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, with plans for further testing and treatment."", type='text')]",0.7733296155929565,0.8125350475311279,0.7924476861953735

[Speaker 2]: Hello. My name is musa. I am 50 years old and i consent to the recording of this conversation 

00:23:59
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

00:01:1800:01:18","[TextBlock(text=""Based on the conversation, the key points are:\n\n1. The patient, a 50-year-old man named Musa, has been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks, which has worsened over time.

The doctor, Dr. Hadiza, asked about Musa's medical history, family history, diet, and social history to gather more information.\n\n3.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:27:23

01:28:04
[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.
01:51:41

01:54:08
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, or fainting?
01:59:25


02:00:45
[Speaker 2]: No, not at all, just cough.
02:08:32

02:10:05
[Speaker 1]: Okay, When the cough comes, How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time does it normally come?
02:17:49

02:19:27
[Speaker 2]: The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.
02:32:23

02:34:11
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?
02:45:04

02:46:56
[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.
03:10:33

03:12:02
[Speaker 1]: Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?
03:16:39

03:18:16
[Speaker 2]: I would say 10 Doc. 10
03:21:28

03:22:31
[Speaker 1]: Okay, What do you think could be causing this?
03:25:10

03:27:50
[Speaker 2]: I don't know. I really don't know.
03:30:45

03:33:33
[Speaker 1]: Are you worried about it?
03:35:08


03:37:59
[Speaker 2]: I am really scared, I am afraid because my father died of stroke. I am scared.
03:44:41

03:46:13
[Speaker 1]: I am sorry to hear about that. It must have been very difficult.  Is there any thing you think I can help you do today?
03:55:40

03:57:38
[Speaker 2]: Doc, You have so many things to for me because I want to feel better. I just want you to tell me that I will be fine and you would do everything in your power to make sure that I am fine.
04:13:15

04:14:14
[Speaker 1]: okay, if I heard you correctly, you said you've been having shortness of breath, and you've been feeling fatigued for the past two weeks. Okay, you said when it starts, you start gasping for breath, like something is choking you as if you are going to die today or tomorrow, and it started gradually. Okay, I have few more questions to ask on your symptoms. Any pain or swelling in your legs or abdomen? Is there any cough, or like dry cough?
04:52:15

Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:46:58
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:49:47
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:43:27
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:45:02
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

[Speaker 2]: Hello. My name is musa. I am 50 years old and i consent to the recording of this conversation 

00:23:59
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

00:01:1800:01:18","Based on the conversation between Doctor Hadiza and Patient Musa, here are the key points:

**Patient's Symptoms:**

* Rectal bleeding for the past two weeks, worsening over time

* Unintentional weight loss
* Feeling tired lately

**Patient's Medical History:**

* Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea)

**Recommended Tests:**

* Colonoscopy to examine the large intestine and potentially remove polyps or take biopsies
* Blood test to rule out other conditions

**Next Steps:**

* Patient will undergo the colonoscopy procedure
* Biopsy results will determine if cancer is present and if so, the best treatment options will be discussed
* Doctor will support the patient through the process and take one step at a time.",0.7886499166488647,0.8065308928489685,0.7974902391433716

03:33:35","## Key Points from Doctor-Patient Conversation:

**Patient:** Peter, 45-year-old male

**Chief Complaint:** Sudden fainting spell earlier that day lasting a few minutes.

**Medical History:**

* Diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago, not always well-controlled.
* Father had a stroke at age 60.
* Currently takes Amlodipine for hypertension, but inconsistently.
* Smokes at least half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years.
* Occasionally drinks alcohol.

**Symptoms:**

* Fainting spell this morning, no warning signs.
* No chest pain, headache, palpitations, or shortness of breath.

**Other:**

* No history of surgery or recreational drug use.
* No known food or drug allergies.

**Next Steps:**

The doctor will likely perform a physical examination and order further tests to determine the cause of Peter's fainting spell. This may include blood work, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and possibly other imaging studies.


**Concerns:**

* Peter's inconsistent medication adherence for hypertension raises concerns about his blood pressure control.
* His smoking history and occasional alcohol consumption are additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
* The family history of stroke further increases his risk.",0.7472615242004395,0.7941131591796875,0.7699752449989319

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:46:58
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:49:47
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

[Speaker 2]: Hello. My name is musa. I am 50 years old and i consent to the recording of this conversation 

00:23:59
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

[Speaker 1]: From my findings, Mrs. Oge, age 26, is having severe and persistent vomiting, which has lasted for 2 weeks now. She finds it difficult to keep down food or liquid. She started vomiting undigested food recently but is no blood or bile on it. The condition is associated with severe nausea and weight loss. She doesn't have any history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain or headache. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago and her pregnancy test read positive. She has no history of similar symptoms in the previous pregnancy, neither does the condition occur when she's not pregnant. She hasn't done any surgery in the past and doesn't have any chronic illness. She also have no family history of similar illness. Mrs. Oge, according to her, does not smoke nor drink. She's not also in any prescription drugs, but she maintained that she started prenatal vitamins after she confirmed pregnant. She doesn't have any known food or drug allergies.

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:46:58
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:49:47
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:43:27
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:45:02
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

[Speaker 1]: Hello. My name is doctor hadiza and i am a general medical practitioner and i consent to the recording of this conversation 


00:13:46
[Speaker 2]: Hello. My name is musa. I am 50 years old and i consent to the recording of this conversation 

00:23:59
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

00:17:43
[Speaker 1]: So, What brought you here today?
00:20:07

00:22:15
[Speaker 2]: Doctor, I have been having shortness of breath, and I have been feeling fatigue for the past two weeks. The pain is just so much; you know how bad it is when you are struggling with your breath. Then another thing is fatigue. The fatigue  is just constant, it never goes, it doesn't want to go.
00:48:00


00:50:07
[Speaker 1]: Okay, So can you tell me more about it?
00:52:47

00:53:02
[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
01:13:15

01:14:26
[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:27:23

01:28:04
[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.
01:51:41

02:17:49

02:19:27
[Speaker 2]: The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.
02:32:23

02:34:11
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?
02:45:04

02:46:56
[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.
03:10:33

03:12:02
[Speaker 1]: Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?
03:16:39

03:57:38
[Speaker 2]: Doc, You have so many things to for me because I want to feel better. I just want you to tell me that I will be fine and you would do everything in your power to make sure that I am fine.
04:13:15

Whatever I take, whether food or water, or anything at all, fluid, I'll vomit it immediately, like the vomit is just like, it's constant, and of recent, I started noticing indigested food in my vomit. That's it.

[Speaker 1]: From my findings, Mrs. Oge, age 26, is having severe and persistent vomiting, which has lasted for 2 weeks now. She finds it difficult to keep down food or liquid. She started vomiting undigested food recently but is no blood or bile on it. The condition is associated with severe nausea and weight loss. She doesn't have any history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain or headache. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago and her pregnancy test read positive. She has no history of similar symptoms in the previous pregnancy, neither does the condition occur when she's not pregnant. She hasn't done any surgery in the past and doesn't have any chronic illness. She also have no family history of similar illness. Mrs. Oge, according to her, does not smoke nor drink. She's not also in any prescription drugs, but she maintained that she started prenatal vitamins after she confirmed pregnant. She doesn't have any known food or drug allergies.
05:59:07
"," Dr. Martin: Mrs. Oge, your symptoms are concerning, but they are consistent with hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness that can occur during pregnancy. It's important to manage your symptoms to ensure both your health and the health of your baby.

Mrs. Oge: Doctor, I'm very worried about my baby. Will my baby be okay?

Dr. Martin: Yes, your baby will be fine. Your pregnancy is progressing well, and we will work together to manage your symptoms and ensure the best possible outcome for both you and your baby.

Mrs. Oge: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your reassurance.

Dr. Martin: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide the necessary support and treatment. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.",0.7604998350143433,0.8339627981185913,0.7955389618873596

Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:46:58
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:49:47
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:43:27
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:45:02
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

06:48:53
[Speaker 2]: No, Doctor. Thank you for your help.

06:51:22
[Speaker 1]: you are welcome, Kemi. we'll get to the bottom of this together and make sure you are feeling better soon. take care.
"," Summary:

Kemi Albert, a 35-year-old female, visited the hospital with her friend Kemi Albert due to pain and swelling in her left leg that started a few days ago. The pain was gradual and severe, rated at 8 out of 10. She also experienced a high-grade fever, especially at night, and numbness and tingling in the affected leg. She had no recent injuries or travel history. Kemi Albert did not take any over-the-counter pain medications, which did not help. She has no chronic diseases, surgeries, or family history of similar illnesses. She occasionally drinks alcohol but does not smoke or use recreational drugs. She is not allergic to any medications or food.

During the consultation, Kemi Albert mentioned her normal menstrual cycle, no abnormal vaginal discharge, itching, or pain, and two children with normal pregnancies and deliveries. She has not had any recent gynaecological exams, surgeries, or sexually transmitted infections. She has been using condoms as contraception.

Based on the discussion, Doctor Bright suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as a possible cause of Kemi Albert's symptoms.

In the meantime, Doctor Bright prescribed medication to help with the pain and swelling.",0.7743536233901978,0.8311342000961304,0.8017398118972778

Alright thank you very much for you responses. 
Alright. Thank you
07:24:59"," It appears that the conversation is between a healthcare professional and a patient who is presenting with symptoms of a high-grade fever that started suddenly a few days ago. The healthcare professional is conducting a history-taking and physical examination to gather information about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and potential risk factors for certain diseases.

The patient reports having a high-grade fever for several days, with the fever being constant and started suddenly. The patient also experiences headaches, chills, and sweating. The patient denies any recent travel, exposure to sick individuals, or any other symptoms such as difficulty urinating, palpitations, leg swelling, or joint pain.

The healthcare professional inquires about the patient's family history, living conditions, and preventive measures against malaria, such as sleeping under insecticide-treated nets and using insect repellents. The patient lives in a malaria-endemic area and does not use these preventive measures.

The healthcare professional suspects that the patient might have malaria due to the symptoms, living in a malaria-endemic area, and lack of preventive measures. The healthcare professional plans to conduct a general examination and further investigations to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

The conversation ends with the healthcare professional thanking the patient for their cooperation and the patient expressing gratitude as well.",0.7429876327514648,0.7950936555862427,0.7681580185890198

[Speaker 2]: Hello. My name is musa. I am 50 years old and i consent to the recording of this conversation 

00:23:59
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

00:01:1800:01:18"," Summary:

The conversation between Doctor Hadiza and patient Musa revolves around Musa's recent health concerns, specifically rectal bleeding and changes in bowel habits. Musa reports bright red blood in his stool, alternating constipation and diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue. Doctor Hadiza inquires about blood on toilet paper, appetite changes, and medical history, including past surgeries, hospitalizations, and family history of cancer. Musa's father had colorectal cancer, and his mother had breast cancer. Doctor Hadiza also asks about smoking and allergies, which Musa denies.

Based on Musa's symptoms, family history, and social history, Doctor Hadiza suspects colorectal cancer as the most likely diagnosis. Other possible conditions include inflammatory bowel disease, polyps, or hemorrhoids. To confirm the diagnosis, Doctor Hadiza recommends a colonoscopy and blood test. If the biopsy results indicate cancer, treatment options will be discussed. Doctor Hadiza reassures Musa that early detection can make a significant difference and offers support throughout the process.",0.7848333120346069,0.8401671051979065,0.8115580677986145

[Speaker 1]: Okay, So can you tell me more about it?
00:52:47

00:53:02
[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
01:13:15

01:14:26
[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:27:23

01:28:04
[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.
01:51:41

01:54:08
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, or fainting?
01:59:25


02:00:45
[Speaker 2]: No, not at all, just cough.
02:08:32

02:10:05
[Speaker 1]: Okay, When the cough comes, How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time does it normally come?
02:17:49

02:19:27
[Speaker 2]: The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.
02:32:23

02:34:11
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?
02:45:04

02:46:56
[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.
03:10:33

03:12:02
[Speaker 1]: Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?
03:16:39

03:18:16
[Speaker 2]: I would say 10 Doc. 10
03:21:28

03:22:31
[Speaker 1]: Okay, What do you think could be causing this?
03:25:10

03:27:50
[Speaker 2]: I don't know. I really don't know.
03:30:45

03:33:33
[Speaker 1]: Are you worried about it?

03:37:59
[Speaker 2]: I am really scared, I am afraid because my father died of stroke. I am scared.
03:44:41

03:46:13
[Speaker 1]: I am sorry to hear about that. It must have been very difficult.  Is there any thing you think I can help you do today?
03:55:40

03:57:38
[Speaker 2]: Doc, You have so many things to for me because I want to feel better. I just want you to tell me that I will be fine and you would do everything in your power to make sure that I am fine.
04:13:15

04:14:14
[Speaker 1]: okay, if I heard you correctly, you said you've been having shortness of breath, and you've been feeling fatigued for the past two weeks. Okay, you said when it starts, you start gasping for breath, like something is choking you as if you are going to die today or tomorrow, and it started gradually. Okay, I have few more questions to ask on your symptoms. Any pain or swelling in your legs or abdomen? Is there any cough, or like dry cough?
04:52:15


04:54:23
[Speaker 2]: Yes, my legs are swollen, they are swelling up, even my abdomen, they are swelling up too and that cough I told you about that time, its dry cough.

[Speaker 1]: Okay, how many do you drink, like, how often do you drink?

08:12:07

08:13:16
[Speaker 1]: Okay, that means you prefer to smoke more than to drink?
08:16:24

08:17:02
[Speaker 2]: Yes, Doctor.
08:18:59

08:19:52
[Speaker 1]: Okay, do you take any recreational drugs?
08:24:59

08:24:53
[Speaker 2]: No, I don't, I can not.
08:27:20

08:30:28
[Speaker 1]: Okay, do you live by yourself? What I mean is, do you stay only you?
08:37:00

08:38:15

08:44:36

[Speaker 1]: Okay, your daughter of how many years, of how old?
08:49:38

08:51:00
[Speaker 2]: My daughter is just ten years old.
08:53:59

08:55:42
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Have you traveled abroad recently?
08:59:01

09:00:34
[Speaker 2]: No I've not traveled, I have been around for a while now.
09:06:32

09:08:24
[Speaker 1]: Okay, I'm going to go through what we've discussed so that anything I said and it wasn't what you said, you now let me know. 
At first, you said you are having shortness of breath, and you are feeling fatigued for the past two weeks, and the pain is just too much on you, the pain is just too much on you, and you do struggle with your breath, and the fatigue is constant. Okay, like something is choking you like you are going to die in next minute, and you said that it started gradually. Okay, like both in the morning, afternoon, and night, the fatigue is constant, and you said the shortness of breath is usually worse, like when you are lying and doing exertion, and on a scale of 10 and you also said your father died of stroke at 60 years. 
You said you have pain and swelling in your legs and abdomen, and your cough is usually dry; you also said your mom is diabetic. Okay, and you are hypertensive. Okay, and you do smoke and drink alcohol, too, but you smoke more than alcohol. And you don't take any recreational drugs. Okay, I just want to let you know that all these questions are as relevant as treatment. From the questions, we get the symptoms, and then we know the next step to follow. Okay, and you live with your wife and your daughter of ten years. Okay, you don't live alone, and you've never traveled abroad.

"," The patient, Ositadinma, is a 55-year-old female presenting with a two-week history of shortness of breath and fatigue. She describes the shortness of breath as a sensation of choking, which started gradually and worsens with exertion and when lying down. The fatigue is constant, and she experiences a dry cough, particularly at night. She has noticed swelling in her legs and abdomen. Ositadinma has a history of poorly controlled hypertension for the past 10 years and a family history of stroke (father) and diabetes (mother). She is a long-term smoker, consuming one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years, and she drinks alcohol occasionally. She does not use recreational drugs and lives with her family.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible cardiovascular or respiratory issue, such as heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The swelling in her legs and abdomen, along with her history of hypertension, raises concern for heart failure. The dry cough and shortness of breath could also indicate COPD, especially given her long history of smoking.

The next steps in the patient's evaluation should include a thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and cardiac biomarkers. Depending on the results, further investigations such as echocardiography, spirometry, and possibly a CT scan of the chest may be warranted.

Management should focus on addressing the underlying cause, which may involve lifestyle modifications (e.g., smoking cessation, alcohol moderation), medication adjustments for hypertension, and potentially initiating treatment for heart failure or COPD if confirmed.",0.7754355669021606,0.8091564774513245,0.7919372320175171
