(12:26) Doctor: Any constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that? (12:29) Patient: Nothing, nothing doctor. (12:31) Doctor: Okay. (12:36) Doctor: So, right now, so, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what can be likely wrong with you right? But to properly diagnose, to like confirm, right? We need to do some investigations, right? (12:53) Doctor: The first thing we need to do is to do a..okay, before I, before I discuss that, I just want to just quickly examine you, right? So, examine your chest basically and listen to your, your lung fields, your right and left lung fields, right? (13:09) Doctor: Then, after we’re done with that, we’ll discuss about it like I’m discussing with you now. (13:14) Doctor: That, we’ll need to do some investigations. We will need to do.. first of all, we’ll need to do a fasting… a full blood count rather, full blood count, we’ll need to do an ESR. Alright? We’ll need to do… (13:26) Patient: Okay? (13:28) Doctor: ESR is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate. It’s usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. (13:36) Patient: Okay. (13:37) Doctor: So we’ll also need to do…and a most important thing, a chest x-ray. Because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not… that has not stopped, even though you have taken… you have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff and you’re still.. it’s still there, so we want to know what’s in your chest that is causing you to have this cough right? (14:00) Patient: Okay, doctor. Doctor: And based on what we are, what, based on what we think it is, there are also some other investigations. The cough that is productive, we need to do like a sputum…so that thing that you’re bringing out in your mouth, we want to.. like.. culture it, and since it's productive, right? So, we need to know, we want to know if there's, we want to know the bacterial cause of, of the cough, the underlying bacterial cause of the cough. (14:27) Doctor: I also want to do, what they call an AFB; acid-fast bacilli. It’s the test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you, alongside the chest x-ray. Right? So when we put all this together and we come to the conclusion about what is wrong with you, that’s when we’ll now start you on medications. Right? (14:48) Doctor: So what it’s looking like is wrong with you is, we’re trying to query what we call tuberculosis right? (14:57) Patient: Doctor, you think I have tuberculosis? (15:00) Doctor: Based on the history, based on the… we are trying to rule it out. I'm not saying you have it right? but the investigations we are going to do is going to make us confirm that diagnosis, right? (15:11) Doctor: My work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints, right? With my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them..which…what can be likely wrong with you. (15:20) Doctor: Then the investigations will now help us to point out definitive diagnosis, right? So the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that I've listed. (15:31) Doctor: So what's..what comes out of it is what's going to like determine our plan, right? Do you understand? (15:38) Patient: Okay doctor. Thank you doctor. Thank you very much.

Heavy sweating. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. Then, about the cough, since you said it's for three months, what have you done about it? What did you do about it? Did you stop at a point or have you been coughing back for about three months. It has become very embarrassing that I've been coughing for so long. So I've spoken to a different man. Yeah, I can hear you. I said I've been coughing for quite a while and it has become embarrassing. So I spoke with a couple of friends. I went to a pharmacy. I got some antibiotics. I got cough syrup. Nothing is working. Nothing is working. I'm even beginning to start losing appetite. I'm very weak. Doctor, I am sick. I am very sick. Okay, okay, cool. No problem. Do you have any chest pain? do you feel anything in your chest? Come again, doctor. I can't hear you. Do you feel any pain in your chest? Any chest pain when you cough? Yes. Yes, when I'm coughing, I feel pain in my chest. And even when I breathe in, when I'm trying to take a deep breath, I feel pain in my chest. Okay. Do you also have any difficulty in swallowing? Just to rule it out, have you had any difficulty in swallowing in the past three months? Just to rule that out. No, no, I have not. No pain in swallowing? No difficulty in swallowing? Okay, no itching.

Have you noticed that you lost weight? Have I noticed what? That you lost weight, that you have lost weight in your center. Yes, I told you about a month ago, I started noticing people started telling me that I've been losing weight. And then I noticed that my clothes are becoming bigger. Okay. I was about to ask how do you joke? You noticed that your clothes that were bigger that were like fitted on you before they are now more loose, right? Yeah, they are now more loose. Okay. Okay, cool. So, do you do you feel any dizziness? Do you feel dizzy at all? Do you feel like you want to faint? Any of those episodes at all? I just feel tired and weak. I just feel tired and weak. Okay. And I want to ask about do you notice... Yeah, what did you say? Doctor, I think I've been running temperature a bit too. Although it's not really much. But for the past one month, I think I've been having some high temperature a bit. Just very small. But any kata before that? Any kata before that? Any kata with difficulties for a little of that, right? No, none of that. Thank you. Any back pain? Any back pain at all? No back pain. What kind of work do you do? What kind of work do you do? I'm a carpenter. I recently travelled for a job. I had to stay with a couple of people that I worked with on the job. Where did you travel to? Hmm? Where did you travel to? Did you travel out of your area, out of your country? Yes. What did you go to? I traveled to India. India. All right. All right. Cool. Yes. All right. So when you said you were trapped, you were in the midst of a lot of people. So when that happened, was there anybody around you then that was coughing, that you noticed that was coughing? Yeah. I shared about two people were coughing. Okay. One person. I think one person was coughing at the time. Do you think I might have gotten the cough from the person? I'm just trying to, yes, there's a possibility. At the end of our conversation, when we have properly tied out what exactly is wrong with you then, we will know if it's from them. But there's a possibility that you got it from people because you were at close proximity to people that have been coughing for a long time. So there's a chance that you got a cough right from them. So if you don't mind, I would like to ask some other follow-up questions. Have you had a loss of appetite? Have you noticed that recently you have not been eating like you want to eat? Yes, I've lost appetite. Okay. I want to ask about your back from LA history. Do you know if you were fully vaccinated? Do you have an immunization card to that effect? Are you aware of that? My immunization? I don't know. I don't know. I think I did all that when I was young. I have not taken any immunization recently. I don't know. Okay. All right. Cool. So I want to ask about, do you have any other complaints? Are you hypertensive? Are you diabetic? Do you have ulcer? Are you asthmatic? No, none of that. I've been very fine until this cough. Okay. Just to also ask, are you married? Come again? Are you married? Are you married? No, I live alone. I live alone. I'm not. I want to ask if there's any recent, any history of multiple sexual partners too or sharing of sharps, something like that. Something in that regard. No, I don't. No, I don't. Have you been sharing sharps with anybody, like your clipper and stuff? I live alone and I have my clipper and everything to myself. I have my personal stuff. Is there anybody in your family that has the same complaint? That you're coughing for? That you know that you have this kind of complaint of coughing for? There is nobody. Anybody in your family? There is nobody. I'm even surprised myself why I'm beginning to develop this cough. Now to ask you about some social questions. Do you smoke? Do you drink alcohol? Do you take about concussions? Any of them? Doctor, I smoke. I smoke. I only take a call locationally. Okay. So about the smoking, how much of smoking? First of all, what do you smoke? How much of it do you smoke per day?

I don't know of any drug allergies. Okay, so I'd like to ask you some general questions about, just some general questions. Any headache, any neck pain, any neck stiffness, anything like that? No, no, none of that. Okay. Any chest pain? So you have chest pain. Any difficulty in breathing? Yes, that has been happening. I've been finding it difficult to breathe and it has been progressively worsening. That is why I had to come to the hospital because everything I have tried has not been working. So please, doctor, help me. Okay, okay. Then any abdominal pain? Anything like that? No, no abdominal pain. No diarrhea, nothing like that? Nothing, nothing like that. Okay. So, right now, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what I'm like here on the team, right? But to properly diagnose, to like confirm, right? We need to do some investigations, right? The first thing we need to do is to do a... Okay, before I discuss that, I just want to just quickly examine you, right? So examine your chest, basically, and listen to your your lung fields your right and left lung fields right then after we're done with that thing we'll discuss about this like i'm discussing with you now that um we need to do some investigations we need to do first of all we need to be fasting a full block counter other block counts we need to do an esr. We need to do most importantly. ESR is erythrocyte. It's usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. We also need to do an ECF session say you have been having this cough for three months that has not resolved. You have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff, and you are still there. So we want to know exactly what's in the HXS causing you to have this cough, right? Okay, doctor. the bacterial cause of the cough. Underlying bacterial cause of the cough. I also want to do what they call an AAFB. I see them as a test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you alongside check-states. When we put all this together and we come to a conclusion about what is drunk with you. That's when we start to see on medications. So, what is looking like is drunk with you is we are trying to query tuberculosis, what we call tuberculosis, right? Based on the history of... Based on the... We are trying to rule it out. I'm not saying you have it right. But the investigations we are going to do is going to make us confirm that diagnosis. My work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints with my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them, what can be likely wrong with you. Then the investigations will not help us to point out definitive diagnosis. So the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that I've listed. So what's, what comes out of it is what's going to like determine our plan, right? Do you understand? Okay, doctor. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Do you have any, do you have? I just want to be fine. I just want you to make me fine. No problem. At the end of the investigations and when the result comes out, people will know. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. All right. One of the things I'd like to add is the fact that we also want to do the HNX part. Also, I said the first one, I said the assistive-vascular specialization. We also want to do HNX part. So those two tests. All right. I'm ready to do any up. Thank you very much.

list of what can be likely wrong with you right but to properly diagnose to like confirm right we need to do some investigations right 12 53 doctor the first thing we need to do is to do a okay before i before i discuss that i just want to just quickly examine you right so examine your chest basically and listen to your your lung fields your right and left lung fields right 13 09 doctor then after we re done with that we ll discuss about it like i m discussing with you now 13 14 doctor that we ll need to do some investigations we will need to do first of all we ll need to do a fasting a full blood count rather full blood count we ll need to do an esr alright we ll need to do 13 26 patient okay 13 28 doctor esr is erythrocyte sedimentation rate it s usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body 13 36 patient okay 13 37 doctor so we ll also need to do and a most important thing a chest x ray because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not that has not stopped even though you have taken you have taken drugs you have taken cough syrup and stuff and you re still it s still there so we want to know what s in your chest that is causing you to have this cough right 14 00 patient okay doctor doctor and based on what we are what based on what we think it is there are also some other investigations the cough that is productive we need to do like a sputum so that thing that you re bringing out in your mouth we want to like culture it and since it s productive right so we need to know we want to know if there s we want to know the bacterial cause of of the cough the underlying bacterial cause of the cough 14 27 doctor i also want to do what they call an afb acid fast bacilli it s the test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you alongside the chest x ray right so when we put all this together and we come to the conclusion about what is wrong with you that s when we ll now start you on medications right 14 48 doctor so what it s looking like is wrong with you is we re trying to query what we call tuberculosis right 14 57 patient doctor you think i have tuberculosis 15 00 doctor based on the history based on the we are trying to rule it out i m not saying you have it right but the investigations we are going to do is going to make us confirm that diagnosis right 15 11 doctor my work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints right with my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them which what can be likely wrong with you 15 20 doctor then the investigations will now help us to point out definitive diagnosis right so the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that i ve listed 15 31 doctor so what s what comes out of it is what s going to like determine our plan
