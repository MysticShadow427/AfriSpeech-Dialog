data/TB/TB.wav,"Alright, good afternoon sir. Good afternoon doctor, good afternoon. How may I help you today? What brought you to the hospital today? Doctor, I'm not fine, I'm not fine. I've been coughing for over three months now. I've been coughing for over three months and then I started to lose weight. I noticed that one last month. Oh. So let's take it one after the other. So let's talk about the cough for a second. So you said you started coughing about three months ago, right? Yes, doctor. Okay, so I want to ask, the cough, do you cough like, is it barky first of all? Like when I say barky, I mean like the sound of a dog. Is it barky? No, doctor. I just cough, normal cough. Normal kind of cough. Okay. When you cough, do you cough like in multiple bouts? I mean, are you cough like cough, cough, cough and stop? Yeah, cough, cough, cough and stop. Or is it just like you cough once and you stop? I want to differentiate both of them. It just comes occasionally. It comes a lot, but it's not in bouts. It just comes and I cough when it comes. Okay. Alright then. So when you cough, do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Do you produce anything in your throat? Yes. Initially, it was yellowish. It was thick. Thick mucus was coming out. It was yellowish. Then later I started noticing some reddish things inside. I don't know whether it is blood. Okay, you noticed some reddish things. First of all, you noticed it was yellowish. Then you noticed some reddish things inside the cough, inside the sputum, the phlegm you produce, right? Yes, it was yellowish at first. It was very thick, yellowish. And then later I started seeing reddish streaks amidst the yellow thickness, thickish sputum. And then I'm not sure. I think it is blood, but I'm not sure. Do you think it is blood, doctor? We'll find out. We'll find out. At the end of the question, we'll properly tie up. At the end of asking you the questions I'm asking you, I’ll be able to tie up what I think is wrong with you. So I'm still going to ask you some other further questions. So about the cough now, do you notice that you sweat a lot in the night? In this past three months, have you been sweating every day in the night? I've been sweating a lot. At first I thought it was the weather, but even when rain started falling, I sweat a lot, heavily sweating. Okay, okay. Then about the cough, since you said it's for three months, what have you done about it? What did you do about it? Did it stop at a point or you have been coughing back and forth for about three months? It has become very embarrassing that I've been coughing for so long. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I said I've been coughing for quite a while, and it has become embarrassing. So I spoke with a couple of friends. I went to a pharmacy. I got some antibiotics. I got cough syrup. Nothing is working. Nothing is working. I'm even beginning to start losing appetite. I'm very weak. Doctor, I am sick. I am very sick. Okay, okay. No problem. Do you have any chest pain? When you cough, do you feel anything in your chest? Come again, doctor. I can't hear you. Do you feel any pain in your chest? Any chest pain when you cough? Yes, yes. Since this cough started? Yes, when I'm coughing, I feel pain in my chest. And even when I breathe in, when I'm trying to take a deep breath, I feel pain in my chest. Okay. Just to rule that out. No, no, I have not. No pain? No itching? Okay, no itching? You have not had any recent history of itching? No. Not like that, right? No, doctor. Okay, okay Fever? No, not really, not really. Not really. So, you said, back to what you said about the, that you have been sweating every night, so I'd like to probe down that area and ask you other questions. Have I noticed what? That you've lost weight, that you've lost weight in recent times Yes, I told you about, about a month ago, I started noticing, people started telling me that I've been losing weight and then I noticed that my clothes are becoming bigger. Okay, I was about to ask that, how do you, you notice that your clothes, your clothes that were bigger, that were like fitted on you before, they are now more loose, right? Yeah, they are now more loose. Okay, okay, cool. I just, I just feel tired and weak. Just feel tired and weak. Okay. Doctor yeah, what did you say? Doctor, I think I've been running temperature a bit though, although it's not, I can't, it's not really much, but for the past one month I think I've been, I've been some, some high temperature a bit, just very small. But, but any catarrh before that? Any, any catarrh before that? Any catarrh? difficulty in swallowing? No. None of that, right? No, no, none of that. Okay. Any, any back pain? Any back pain at all? No back pain. No back pain. No back pain. Okay. What kind of work do you do? And where do you work? What kind of work do you do? I'm a carpenter and I recently travelled, travelled for a job. I actually stay with a couple of people that I worked with on the job. Where, where, where, where did you travel to? Hmm? Where did you travel to? Did you travel out of your area, out of your country? Yes. What area? Where did you go to? I travelled, I travelled to India. India. All right. All right, cool. Yes. So, when you say.. where you travelled, you were in the midst of a lot of people. So, when, when, when that happened, was there anybody around you then that was coughing, that you noticed that was coughing? Yeah, yeah, I shared… some, some, some, about two people were coughing. I'm just trying to.. yes, there's a possibility. At the end of our conversation, when we are properly tied out what exactly is wrong with you then, we will know if it's from them. Because..but there's a possibility that you got it from people because of, because you were at close proximity to people that have been coughing for a long time. So, there's a chance that you got a cough right from them. So, if you don't mind, I would like to ask some other follow up questions. Yes, I've lost, I've lost appetite. Okay. And I want to ask about your.. back from...from earlier history. My immunization? I don't know. I don't know. I think I did all that when I was younger. Right, cool. No, none of that. I've been very fine until this cough. Okay. Come again? Are you married? Are you married? No, I live alone. I live alone. I'm not. Okay. While I'm asking, I want to ask if there's any recent, any history of like multiple sexual partners too, or sharing of sharps, something like that. Something that..in that regard. No, I don't. No, I don't. Have you been, have you been sharing sharps with anybody, like your clipper and stuff? I live alone and I have my clipper and everything to myself. Is there anybody in your family that has the same complaint, that has been coughing for..that you know, that has the same complaint of coughing for, for about this long? There is nobody. There is nobody. Anybody in your family? Anybody in your family? There is nobody. I'm even surprised myself, why I'm beginning to develop this cough. Now to ask you about some, some social questions. Doctor, I smoke. I smoke. So, you smoke, how many..? I only take alcohol occasionally. Okay. So, about this, about the smoking, how, how much of smoking, first of all, what do you smoke? Then what, what…how much of it do you smoke per day? I smoke cigarettes. I smoke cigarettes and I, I smoke about, about ten, ten sticks per day. Okay. All right. No, I don't. I don't know of any, any drug allergies. Okay. So, I would like to ask you some general questions about…just some general questions. Any headache, any neck pain, any neck stiffness, anything like that? None, none, none of that. Yes, that, that has been happening. Okay, noted. Then any abdominal pain, anything like that? No, no, no abdominal pain. Any constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that? Nothing, nothing doctor. Okay. So, right now, so, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what can be likely wrong with you right? But to properly diagnose, to like confirm, right? We need to do some investigations, right? The first thing we need to do is to do a..okay, before I, before I discuss that, I just want to just quickly examine you, right? So, examine your chest basically and listen to your, your lung fields, your right and left lung fields, right? Then, after we’re done with that, we’ll discuss about it like I’m discussing with you now. That, we’ll need to do some investigations. We will need to do.. first of all, we’ll need to do a fasting… a full blood count rather, full blood count, we’ll need to do an ESR. Alright? We’ll need to do… Okay? ESR is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate. It’s usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. Okay. So we’ll also need to do…and a most important thing, a chest x-ray. Because you said you have been having this cough for three months that has not… that has not stopped, even though you have taken… you have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff and you’re still.. it’s still there, so we want to know what’s in your chest that is causing you to have this cough right? Okay, doctor. And based on what we are, what, based on what we think it is, there are also some other investigations. The cough that is productive, we need to do like a sputum…so that thing that you’re bringing out in your mouth, we want to.. like.. culture it, and since it's productive, right? So, we need to know, we want to know if there's, we want to know the bacterial cause of, of the cough, the underlying bacterial cause of the cough. I also want to do, what they call an AFB; acid-fast bacilli. It’s the test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you, alongside the chest x-ray. Right? So when we put all this together and we come to the conclusion about what is wrong with you, that’s when we’ll now start you on medications. Right? So what it’s looking like is wrong with you is, we’re trying to query what we call tuberculosis right? Doctor, you think I have tuberculosis? Based on the history, based on the… we are trying to rule it out. My work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints, right? With my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them..which…what can be likely wrong with you. Then the investigations will now help us to point out definitive diagnosis, right? So the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that I've listed. So what's..what comes out of it is what's going to like determine our plan, right? Do you understand? Okay doctor. Do you have any, do you have anything you want to, any concern, anything? I just, I just want to be fine. No problem. At the end of..at the end of the investigations and when the result comes out, we'll, we'll, we'll know. Thank you doctor. Thank you very much. One other thing I'd like to add is the fact that we, we also want to do a gene xpert. Okay. I'm ready to do any of those. Thank you very much doctor. Yeah, no problem. No problem."," All right.

And I want to ask about do you notice... Yeah, what did you say? Doctor, I think I've been running temperature a bit too. Although it's not really much. But for the past one month, I think I've been having some high temperature a bit. Just very small. But any kata before that? Any kata before that? Any kata with difficulties for a little of that, right? No, none of that. Thank you. Any back pain? Any back pain at all? No back pain. What kind of work do you do? What kind of work do you do? I'm a carpenter. I recently travelled for a job. I had to stay with a couple of people that I worked with on the job. Where did you travel to? Hmm? Where did you travel to? Did you travel out of your area, out of your country? Yes. What did you go to? I traveled to India. India. All right. All right. Cool. Yes. All right. So when you said you were trapped, you were in the midst of a lot of people. So when that happened, was there anybody around you then that was coughing, that you noticed that was coughing? Yeah. I shared about two people were coughing. Okay. One person. I think one person was coughing at the time. Do you think I might have gotten the cough from the person? I'm just trying to, yes, there's a possibility. At the end of our conversation, when we have properly tied out what exactly is wrong with you then, we will know if it's from them. But there's a possibility that you got it from people because you were at close proximity to people that have been coughing for a long time. So there's a chance that you got a cough right from them. So if you don't mind, I would like to ask some other follow-up questions. Have you had a loss of appetite? Have you noticed that recently you have not been eating like you want to eat? Yes, I've lost appetite. Okay. I want to ask about your back from LA history. Do you know if you were fully vaccinated? Do you have an immunization card to that effect? Are you aware of that? My immunization? I don't know. I don't know. I think I did all that when I was young. I have not taken any immunization recently. I don't know. Okay. All right. Cool. So I want to ask about, do you have any other complaints? Are you hypertensive? Are you diabetic? Do you have ulcer? Are you asthmatic? No, none of that. I've been very fine until this cough. Okay. Just to also ask, are you married? Come again? Are you married? Are you married? No, I live alone. I live alone. I'm not. I want to ask if there's any recent, any history of multiple sexual partners too or sharing of sharps, something like that. Something in that regard. No, I don't. No, I don't. Have you been sharing sharps with anybody, like your clipper and stuff? I live alone and I have my clipper and everything to myself. I have my personal stuff. Is there anybody in your family that has the same complaint? That you're coughing for? That you know that you have this kind of complaint of coughing for? There is nobody. Anybody in your family? There is nobody. I'm even surprised myself why I'm beginning to develop this cough. Now to ask you about some social questions. Do you smoke? Do you drink alcohol? Do you take about concussions? Any of them? Doctor, I smoke. I smoke. I only take a call locationally. Okay. So about the smoking, how much of smoking? First of all, what do you smoke? How much of it do you smoke per day? I smoke cigarettes. I smoke cigarettes and I smoke about 10 sticks per day. I've been smoking for the past 10 years. Okay. All right. Is there any drug that you're allergic to? No, I don't. I don't know of any drug allergies. Okay, so I'd like to ask you some general questions about, just some general questions. Any headache, any neck pain, any neck stiffness, anything like that? No, no, none of that. Okay. Any chest pain? So you have chest pain. Any difficulty in breathing? Yes, that has been happening. I've been finding it difficult to breathe and it has been progressively worsening. That is why I had to come to the hospital because everything I have tried has not been working. So please, doctor, help me. Okay, okay. Then any abdominal pain? Anything like that? No, no abdominal pain. No diarrhea, nothing like that? Nothing, nothing like that. Okay. So, right now, at the end of our conversation, I've been able to have a list of what I'm like here on the team, right? But to properly diagnose, to like confirm, right? We need to do some investigations, right? The first thing we need to do is to do a... Okay, before I discuss that, I just want to just quickly examine you, right? So examine your chest, basically, and listen to your your lung fields your right and left lung fields right then after we're done with that thing we'll discuss about this like i'm discussing with you now that um we need to do some investigations we need to do first of all we need to be fasting a full block counter other block counts we need to do an esr. We need to do most importantly. ESR is erythrocyte. It's usually a marker for acute inflammation in the body. We also need to do an ECF session say you have been having this cough for three months that has not resolved. You have taken drugs, you have taken cough syrup and stuff, and you are still there. So we want to know exactly what's in the HXS causing you to have this cough, right? Okay, doctor. the bacterial cause of the cough. Underlying bacterial cause of the cough. I also want to do what they call an AAFB. I see them as a test that we need to use to query what we feel is wrong with you alongside check-states. When we put all this together and we come to a conclusion about what is drunk with you. That's when we start to see on medications. So, what is looking like is drunk with you is we are trying to query tuberculosis, what we call tuberculosis, right? Based on the history of... Based on the... We are trying to rule it out. I'm not saying you have it right. But the investigations we are going to do is going to make us confirm that diagnosis. My work as a doctor is to tie up your complaints with my experience and my knowledge to be able to know which of them, what can be likely wrong with you. Then the investigations will not help us to point out definitive diagnosis. So the definitive diagnosis will be after we have done these labs that I've listed. So what's, what comes out of it is what's going to like determine our plan, right? Do you understand? Okay, doctor. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Do you have any, do you have? I just want to be fine. I just want you to make me fine. No problem. At the end of the investigations and when the result comes out, people will know. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. All right. One of the things I'd like to add is the fact that we also want to do the HNX part. Also, I said the first one, I said the assistive-vascular specialization. We also want to do HNX part. So those two tests. All right. I'm ready to do any up. Thank you very much. No problem.",all right good afternoon sir good afternoon doctor good afternoon how may i help you today what brought you to the hospital today doctor i m not fine no i m not fine i ve been coughing
