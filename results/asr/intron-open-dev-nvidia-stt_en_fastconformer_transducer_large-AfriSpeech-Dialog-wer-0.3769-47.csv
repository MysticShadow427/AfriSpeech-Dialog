My name is doctor hadiza and i am a general medical practitioner and i consent to the recording of this conversation Hello. My name is musa. I am 50 years old and i consent to the recording of this conversation Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today? Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room? Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations? I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad? Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer Ok That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke? I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance? No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor? Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help You are very much welcome. So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""",hello my name is doctor hatiza and i am a general um medical practitioner and i consent to the

Okay, my name is Adebayo Omowunmi and I consent to the recording of this audio. So today's topic is who or what defines morality. Morality is a concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on what defines it. Some believe that morality is determined by religious beliefs or cultural norms, while others argue that it is based on personal values and principles. Ultimately, who or what defines morality? Ultimately, the who or what defines morality is a complex and subjective topic, often influenced by a combination of factors such as upbringing, societal influences, and personal experiences. In this sense, mortality can be, morality can be seen as a fluid and constantly evolving concept shaped by individuals and collective perceptions and understandings. So, Bayo, what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality? Okay, this is quite a tricky question, says that what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality? Well, one of the things that I've affected, that have greatly influenced my moral values, that would be my upbringing. You see, one of the, as we were growing up, at least up to the time I remember, I was living, I was conscious, but I remember my parents, they were very strict about what we did, our behaviour to ourselves and to others. And they always think about, and they always prioritize one thing, even aside our education and our religious activities that we have good, that we had good upbringing. Number one, one of the things that they taught us. So when in my early stages of life, good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever you see an elderly person, you greet the person. If you see, if you see somebody older than you, you know how to call him, maybe you call him brother so, so, so. Brother, brother Faith. Exactly. Uncle Faith. If he's much older than you or daddy Faith, depending on if he has given birth or daddy and all those simple etiquettes, those can, those are things, those are the moral values I was taught while growing up. Then it goes to, then we talk about societal influences. Now, when one of the things that also the time directly influence my, for us what they call my moral, my morality, that would be my social influences. Because while I was in school, even if I weren't taught by my parents, I would see how people were relating to other people. My younger people would talk to me. Hey, good afternoon, sir. When you see another person greeting the time of day. Good afternoon, ma. Good afternoon, madam. If you want to be someone, you don't know even his name, you know how to address the person. And if you, sorry, and if, and when you see somebody, even older than you want, you know how to address the person. So, and even if I didn't, like I said, even if I didn't see all these things around me, I was. I went to my place, I was all these things around me. So some of the things that influence my moral, my moral values. So thank you, Bayo but I also like the take something on that. All of the things that influenced my moral values is when I was young, when I used to grow up, I would be given, I'll be given something by many of my uncle or my auntie or someone I know. So when I'm given that thing, maybe my, my sibling will be with me and he will ask some of, some of it for me. Some children that were not well brought up, they would respond negatively that they were not going to give selfishly in a way that they used to do while we were young, they would have clench their shoulder close to their cheek and they will say, son, so that thing used to irritate my parents. And when I grow, also began to irritate me. But when I was young, my parents always taught me that when I asked or something, I will give, I must give, I should give. And even if I don't want to give, I would deny polite, in a polite manner, not show, up in your shoulder because that irritated them so much that they had to, they even had to caution some children that were not there or even when they, when they saw it. And what we done in my life, because of all these things that I've been taught, whenever someone asks me for something, it's always on my mind. That it, it is, that I should give it. But as someone, the person is asking, I'm releasing it, because I have conditioned my heart that once someone asks, you are going to give. And another thing in life is that the way that I've given people, given people that this person is good, that even when I've given him, he's going to give me. And even when I give him, even when he gives me, I'm going to give him. So all that mutual and vice versa cycle has always continued in my life and it has always helped me in my moral values. So over to the next topic, which is. Wait, let's not go dancing. Yes, let me, I have something to add. So I'll also ask you something. Now, one of the things also that my parents taught me growing up is that we always learn to share. Some other children will just look at it that, look at what I have, how can I share out of it. But one thing my parents always emphasize was that no matter how little or no matter how big it is, you always share. There was certain children in our house and neighbors. They had, they had, they had an only child for the child was about five. But five years later, they had the second born. The difference was about five years. So whenever they think they were born from the younger one, the older one will not share. The younger one was share because. And so if the other one wanted something, you have to steal from the other one. Maybe they take the thing off his hand. So only, you take your share and walk away. This caused a lot of this, problem for the, conflicts for the parents. Because they were always reporting issues. Hey, mom, this, this did to me. Hey, mom, this did that to me. It gave them a lot of problem, and this was because couldn't the children have to share? My parents foresaw this and make sure that no matter, even though I was, I had the little savings. No matter how much what I had, I always learned to share. No matter how small, what the condition, whatever I had, we shared. Whether it was much, whether it was little, whether it was even sufficient, we would share. We would just share it. That's one of the great moral upgrades that my parents gave me, which I'm gratefully appreciate it for. So I think we can go to the next topic now. And thank you, Bayo, for your contribution, for your contribution, and I would like to cite another example. At my place of work, there used to be, there was a, an executive officer that he was. He wasn't even really into sharing. This is not really into sharing, but I mean, that's moral value and a moral value. This executive officer, whenever he sees his, yes, thank you Bayo, his subordinate, it would not show the subordinate, expect the subordinate, to give greeting. He will greet before the subordinate. Even though the, even though he, some others, some people will feel that I'm in a higher position. This person supposed to greet me before I greet him, and he will not greet him, and if you don't greet me, I want to make sure you pay for it. But this man, this, this officer wasn't like that. Once he saw you, this, this is my, this is my, my friend, and this is my subordinate, he will greet and the person respond to him very politely. This also helped the relationship with other people, because there was even a time that. There was even a time that this man was sorry, so there was even a time that this man was. There was around his personality and his job. So it was questioned by the administrative, administrative office and the administrators. So when it was questioned, it was, it was, it was, the evidence again was against him. But when the peoples, when people heard about this, the subordinates , but when they heard about this, they were very confused that this man, this man is our friend that greet us well, how could he do such a thing. So the people, the officers were not satisfied with their, with their, what they did, what they had, they had concluded to do, to fire him or even demote him to a lower level. But when the, when I said, I mean, the subordinate were alerted, when they heard of this, they pleaded on his behalf for what he had done and they encouraged, they convinced, they successfully convinced their administrative on to, on his, his punishment, and they, they just gave me a second check, because it was not much of an offense, but they gave me a second chance and the man was not. They didn't take that from the. I also remember one of the, an instance where was, that was. When was that? Anyway, I had a story from my friends that there was. No, sorry, pardon me, let me give this example. I went to one of my friends house. We both grew, we both grew up together, we've known each other since high school. So we went to, I went to his house and already he has married and given birth. So we went, we went together for like a get together party. So I met him there, and everybody was discussing, because we were many hey, Lagbaja, we've not seen today, how is business, how is family, this and that, everybody discussing. In the height of all the laughter, everybody was happy relating with one another. That's when we sent for one child to get him what's the Chivita pack, because he wanted to, we just ran out of Chivita. So the girl wasn't happy that something conflict she had with her mom, so as soon as they grumbling, you know, the way these poor children behave, everybody was greatly appalled by her behaviour . Everybody turned to I said, who just displayed that character? Instantly the man was caught with shame, and my friend was caught to shame, and he said it again, in a louder voice. go do this and this, and even, she complained even louder to him. This, this, what can I say? It caught everybody's attention even more that wow? What again? Then instantly, then instantly. The next time, she said it a third time. And next thing, she went up to his feet, took his slipper, and she slapped the slipper against his face. Everybody was jaw dropped. I didn't even myself, I was, I didn't even know when my, literally, when my jaw just dropped. You can imagine what, how this girl had embarrassed her father, because her father couldn't teach her moral values. Let me also take you to one of the time when I went to my friends home, as I got there, I had heavy load because I had heavy loads. So as I got out of my car and I greeted, when they saw me, they couldn't even greet me, his children, they couldn't greet me. They were looking at me to take, even take my bag, they couldn't. But my friend had to tell them, hey, go and take his bag now, go and take his bag. They couldn't do that. So imagine how this lack of moral values have disgraced his father. It's affecting his family because those children will never listen to him respectfully. Who is this one now? Who is this one now? And Bayo, not only this family with this moral, lack of moral values affect, it will even affect the children's family, because they have not been taught so why would they teach their children? Exactly, because it's what, and it's because, and it's what they know now that they would treat their children. They can't just get off the roof of their heads and hey, people are supposed to do. That's what I'm saying, so this is what, this is what is affecting moral values. You see how moral value is affected. That's why I'm grateful for my parents teaching that, they talked me up and they brought me up very well. Thank you, Bayo. So can we proceed to the second topic? Yes. So Bayo what are some common factors that people use to determine what is morally right or wrong? Okay, now I had a very, I had a friend, she said that she was a very religious person. And when I tell you, a very religious person, I mean very religious person, it's not on the scale you think that she's, when I say religious person, I mean someone that is really, really, what can I say? Not biblical, but very religious. She believed that nobody could really determine what was right or wrong, that only God could do that. You can imagine that if anybody, and if we try to determine, to what's wrong or not, we won't be coy because we are not, we are not, humans are not perfect. I quite agree, but not in that sense. So, so what she did was that she, whenever she saw that, she, whenever she thought of anything that she would tell her heart that her God, what do you want me to do? Is this thing correct? Is this thing right? Is this thing wrong? Is this thing morally correct? and this thing was quite, I must say, it was quite strange to me that what is this woman doing? It was a very odd way of going to determine what is right and wrong. Yes. So let me give you another example, another thing, factor that people think to use to determine what is morally right and morally wrong. Some people, some people believe that society's accepted standards of behaviour often shape people moral compass. What a society accepts this, accept that you don't do this, that you don't do that, that is what they are. They believe in their, that's what they use there, is their moral compass. This is what our society accepts. This is what our culture accept, so this is what one of the things that determines what people do. So now what about our personal concept, conscience, intuition, people just use the, this thing I'm about to do, it doesn't feel right and if it's being done to me, I wouldn't like it. You might be such a selfish. I really appreciate that. I wouldn't like it. It wouldn't do it. This thing I'm about to do, is it really good? And another thing is that a personal reflection play a role. You reflect over what you want to do that what I, look at the consequences I want to do, Is it a good thing to do? Can I take it from someone else? and all these things play a role in guiding individuals to discern right from wrong. So then you also look at the. Some people assess the morality of an action based on its consequences. So they consider it. This is the concept of if I do this thing, this is the consequence if I don't do it. So they weigh their options, which one pays me, which one doesn't. So they do this to, aiming to maximize overall happiness and to minimize suffering. So let's look at ethical principles. Philosophical frameworks such as kantian ethics, virtue ethics and social contract theory provide guidelines for determining moral behavior. So some of the things, factors that, what can I say, that, common factor that people used to determine what is morally right or wrong. Thank you Bayo and I also like to give some, I also like to answer that question. So, some of the factors that also determine what is morally right or morally wrong is the legal, is the legal system. Because while laws may not always align perfectly with morality, they often reflect sociality, societal values and influence on individuals perceptions of right and wrong. So their perceptions of right and wrong, so most people think about legal system also part of what they used to determine the morality. For example, when you have a case, when you have a case with someone, a problem, maybe someone took your land, they said, this is where his land stop, this is where yours begins, and this is where mine starts. So when we attitude to the court, the court is not, you determine the, the outcome. Yes, the outcome of the case because they will use the evidence available with them that okay, this is, this is the, for example, this is the survey of the land. So if you, I don't care, you are correct. So that's how the law uses their legal system to, to determine moral values. So, Bayo, do you have anything else that you would like to say? No, I don't think so. Okay but I'm just listening. One last thing. So another thing is human rights. Because many people base their normal moral judgment on principles of equality, justice and the protection of fundamental rights. Because even when some people, when people have their own belief, that okay, these are what I think, I believe that is correct morally, when they look at it in the eyes of this human activist, would I be correct? Because of this equality will I be correct? Because of the rights they claim for this, because of the rights that they claim for this person, would they like it? Would they take it from me? So the person would not like to align all these beliefs with what that other person's human rights says. So, Bayo, just to conclude, do you have any other thing you'd like to say? No, I don't. Thank you. Thank you Bayo. It's a very good conversation. Thank you for your contribution too. Thank you.",my name is aburio too and i consent to recording of this audio okay my name is adibayo mumumi and i consent to recording of this audio so today's topic is who or what defines morality morality is a concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on what defines it some believe that marty is determined by religious beliefs or cultural norms while others argue that it is based on personal values and principles ultimately who or what complex topic of fully influenced by combination of factors such as bringing social influences and personal experiences in this sense can be seen as a fluid and constantly evolving concept shaped by individual collective perceptions and understanding so bio what would you see is influence it is a very strict question says what would you say is to be questioned influence on your personal sense of morality one of the things that i've affected have greatly influenced my moral values that would be my upbringing you see one of the as we were growing up to the time i remember i was leaving i was conscious they were very strict about what we did us and you always think always prioritize wanted even aside religious activities that we have bringing about one of the things that you taught us so one of my advice is of life good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever i see another person you greek the person if you see somebody or that you you know are to call me according brothers who brought our face exactly on faith if it's more children than are you or daddy faith and if you are giving birth or daddy and all those simple air tickets those kind those are things those are the more values i was taught while growing up then it goes to then societal influences now when all of the things

mutual and vice versa i always continued it always help me so over to the next topic which let's go with that let me ask you so i was access something i want to do things are so that my parents taught i was growing up is that you always learn to share some other children we don't look at look at what i have i can i shot of this one thing my parents always emphasize was that little you always share they were saying to their house and neighbors they had uh they had they had their only child for they had about five minutes later that is a common the difference about five years so whatever the thing was both from the younger one the older one will not share the older one share because i'm safe the older one wanted something you have to steal from the down one tip the thing off his hand i would take a shower walk away this was a lot of this program for the conflicts for the parents because they were always reporting issues here mom did this to me mom did is that to me you give them a lot of problem and this was because it couldn't get to share my parents for saw this and make sure that no matter even though i was i were i had to do it too seriously no matter how mo what i had i always learned to share no matter how small what the condition whatever i had to shared whether it was much whether it was little whether it was even sufficient that's all great mob operations that my parents which i'm grateful so i think we can go to the next subject thank you contribution i would like to set down the example at at my place of work there used to be there was a an executive officer that he was he wasn't even really into sharing it's not really into sharing but i mean that's more value this one yes thank you by your insubordinate it would not shun his subordinates give greeting he won't greet before the subordinate even though the even though he's feel that you are i mean supposed to greet me before i greet him and greet him and if you don't greet you i want to make sure you pay for it but this man this officer wasn't like that it was his sorry and this this is my this is my my friend this is my son will greet and and the person who respond to him put very polite this also helped the relationship with a lot of people because there was even a time that there was even a time that sorry so there was even a time lady smile was there was actually disarm this and personality and his job so was question by the administrative administrative office and the administrative so when it was question it was it was it was evidence again was against him when did people where did people say when add about this this is it but when they add about this they were very confused this man this afraid i wish also how could he do so detail so the people the office house were not satisfied with their what they did what's their they had completed to do to fire him or even devote him to a lower level but when the when i sovereignt where that when they heard of this they they pleaded on his behalf for what he had done college they convinced they successfully convinced their administrative on to all his own punishments and someone then just gave me a second chance because it was not much of an offence but they gave me a second chance and their mum was not an take that from the end so i saw him by one of the stance where i was that was that anyway i understood from my friends that there was no sorry pardon me let me give this example i went to one of my friends house we brought you up together we need since i school so we went i went to my dad events together get together party so i met him there and everybody was discussing 'cause we're many hey says luck but today how his business obvious family stand that what is because i in the heights of all the laughter everybody was happy listen in the sense for one child to get him was to copy t v top park and of course wanted to we just run out of chivita so i the guy wasn't half hurry halfway dust because with something coffee shop with our mom so i soon actually there grumbling ya me ya the way that these four children behave everybody was really appalled by i've been everybody told us lah who does it started my mom was caught with sham was called to sham and he said it again go this in the louder voice gondos and again yeah even even what kind of complaint even louder this this fam this fair what can i say it's called everybody after shady moon models wah again again then instantly what she said is a tall time and after the other she went up to she took a step as he slapped his face everybody was jaw dropped i need myself i was i don't know where my my george dropped you can imagine what how does get at them i asked our father because i put out let me take it to one time when i went to my friend to my friend i got i got there i had every loose because i did every loads i got out of my canal and i greeted when they saw they couldn't even greet me children they couldn't greet in the world looking at me take it would take one by they couldn't at least my friend out to tell them hey take his bag now go and take his bag they couldn't do that so imagine how this lack of moral values are disgraced because those children will never listen to him respectfully was this one exactly is what they know now that they would teach our children you can't just get out of you of you for their he's a hey he was supposed to do so i'm what is affecting moral values affected that's why i'm wishing for my parents and i did talk and it brought me so called yes so what factors that people use to determine what is my okay now i do i do friend she said that she was a very religious person and when i tell you very i mean very religious person it's not only skilled you think that she's going to trust just as i mean someone that can i see bipart very religious she believed that nobody could really determine what was right or wrong god could do that you can imagine that if anybody to draw it because i know it's not it wasn't all perfect i quite agree well not in that sense what she did that she would she saw that she actually talked about it and she would tell our heart of how god what you want me to do what is correct correct what this day was quite i must say it was quite strange to me that what is this woman doing it was a very odd way of determining what is right or wrong yes so let me give another example another factor that people think to use you to deter what is my right i don't some people believe that societies set standards of beavio ship people's moran post society sept that you don't do this that you don't do that that is what they believe in that need this is what our society accepts these with our cultural asset so this is what it is that people do so now that conscious conscious intuition who does you do it about to do it doesn't feel right if it's being done to me i wouldn't like it why this sort of suffered i really appreciate that i wouldn't like it i wouldn't do it but this time about to do is really good and a personal reflection play role you reflect over what you want to do that what i'm doing the consequences wrong i want to do would it is it a good thing to do can i take it from someone else you and gear i'm seeing and the only thing is play a role in gannivar individuals discern right from wrong so then you also look id some people i says to marty of an action based on its consequences so consider that this is a cost if i don't so they wait out shows which of pays me which one doesn't so they do this to amy to my demise well happiness and to me and suffering so principles it does typical framework such as concerts virtue ethics and social contract theory provide guidelines for disarming moral behavior so on it is artist that people used to tell me what is my right thank you i also like to give that question so some of the factors does so did tell me what is the guy is a legal system because while laws may not always align perfectly with moral reflect social values and influence on individuals perceptions of rights so sorry so and their perceptions of right and wrong so they are part of what they used to determine for example when you have a case where someone a problem disease lunch so this is where yours begins and this is where my stance and israel so when the attitude to the court the court is not determined because they will use the evidence and they this is the this is the soviet of the law so you are okay you are correct so that's our legal system to determine more values so bio do you have anything else that you would like to say one thing so i'm not in many people busy judgments principles of equality justice and the potential of what i because even where people have their own what i think i believe when they look at it in the eyes of this human activists will i be correct because of the sequoyah because of the rights they played for the president would they like it would they take it from me so person would not like to live all these bees with what that's human rights sees so bios you have a lot to see i mean thank you thank you for a good thank you for your contribution,my name is aburio too and i consent to recording of this audio okay my name is adibayo mumumi and i consent to recording of this audio so today's topic is who or what defines morality morality is a concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on what defines it some believe that marty is determined by religious beliefs or cultural norms while others argue that it is based on personal values and principles ultimately who or what complex topic of fully influenced by combination of factors such as bringing social influences and personal experiences in this sense can be seen as a fluid and constantly evolving concept shaped by individual collective perceptions and understanding so bio what would you see is influence it is a very strict question says what would you say is to be questioned influence on your personal sense of morality one of the things that i've affected have greatly influenced my moral values that would be my upbringing you see one of the as we were growing up to the time i remember i was leaving i was conscious they were very strict about what we did us and you always think always prioritize wanted even aside religious activities that we have bringing about one of the things that you taught us so one of my advice is of life good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever i see another person you greek the person if you see somebody or that you you know are to call me according brothers who brought our face exactly on faith if it's more children than are you or daddy faith and if you are giving birth or daddy and all those simple air tickets those kind those are things those are the more values i was taught while growing up then it goes to then societal influences now when all of the things that are so the time directing fast mywhat do you call my moral my moral thing that would be my sister influences because while i was in school even if i weren't taught by my parents i would see how

contribution,"my name is abulorin otu and i consent to recording of this audio. okay, my name is adebayo omowunmi and i consent to the recording of this audio. so today's topic is who or what defines morality. morality is a concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on what defines it. some believe that morality is determined by religious beliefs or cultural norms, while others argue that it is based on personal values and principles. ultimately, who or what defines morality? ultimately, the who or what defines morality is a complex and subjective topic, often influenced by a combination of factors such as upbringing, societal influences, and personal experiences. in this sense, mortality can be, morality can be seen as a fluid and constantly evolving concept shaped by individuals and collective perceptions and understandings. so, bayo, what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality? okay, this is quite a tricky question, says that what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality? well, one of the things that i've affected, that have greatly influenced my moral values, that would be my upbringing. you see, one of the, as we were growing up, at least up to the time i remember, i was living, i was conscious, but i remember my parents, they were very strict about what we did, our behaviour to ourselves and to others. and they always think about, and they always prioritize one thing, even aside our education and our religious activities that we have good, that we had good upbringing. number one, one of the things that they taught us. so when in my early stages of life, good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever you see an elderly person, you greet the person. if you see, if you see somebody older than you, you know how to call him, maybe you call him brother so, so, so. brother, brother faith. exactly. uncle faith. if he's much older than you or daddy faith, depending on if he has given birth or daddy and all those simple etiquettes, those can, those are things, those are the moral values i was taught while growing up. then it goes to, then we talk about societal influences. now, when one of the things that also the time directly influence my, for us what they call my moral, my morality, that would be my social influences. because while i was in school, even if i weren't taught by my parents, i would see how people were relating to other people. my younger people would talk to me. hey, good afternoon, sir. when you see another person greeting the time of day. good afternoon, ma. good afternoon, madam. if you want to be someone, you don't know even his name, you know how to address the person. and if you, sorry, and if, and when you see somebody, even older than you want, you know how to address the person. so, and even if i didn't, like i said, even if i didn't see all these things around me, i was. i went to my place, i was all these things around me. so some of the things that influence my moral, my moral values. so thank you, bayo but i also like the take something on that. all of the things that influenced my moral values is when i was young, when i used to grow up, i would be given, i'll be given something by many of my uncle or my auntie or someone i know. so when i'm given that thing, maybe my, my sibling will be with me and he will ask some of, some of it for me. some children that were not well brought up, they would respond negatively that they were not going to give selfishly in a way that they used to do while we were young, they would have clench their shoulder close to their cheek and they will say, son, so that thing used to irritate my parents. and when i grow, also began to irritate me. but when i was young, my parents always taught me that when i asked or something, i will give, i must give, i should give. and even if i don't want to give, i would deny polite, in a polite manner, not show, up in your shoulder because that irritated them so much that they had to, they even had to caution some children that were not there or even when they, when they saw it. and what we done in my life, because of all these things that i've been taught, whenever someone asks me for something, it's always on my mind. that it, it is, that i should give it. but as someone, the person is asking, i'm releasing it, because i have conditioned my heart that once someone asks, you are going to give. and another thing in life is that the way that i've given people, given people that this person is good, that even when i've given him, he's going to give me. and even when i give him, even when he gives me, i'm going to give him. so all that mutual and vice versa cycle has always continued in my life and it has always helped me in my moral values. so over to the next topic, which is. wait, let's not go dancing. yes, let me, i have something to add. so i'll also ask you something. now, one of the things also that my parents taught me growing up is that we always learn to share. some other children will just look at it that, look at what i have, how can i share out of it. but one thing my parents always emphasize was that no matter how little or no matter how big it is, you always share. there was certain children in our house and neighbors. they had, they had, they had an only child for the child was about five. but five years later, they had the second born. the difference was about five years. so whenever they think they were born from the younger one, the older one will not share. the younger one was share because. and so if the other one wanted something, you have to steal from the other one. maybe they take the thing off his hand. so only, you take your share and walk away. this caused a lot of this, problem for the, conflicts for the parents. because they were always reporting issues. hey, mom, this, this did to me. hey, mom, this did that to me. it gave them a lot of problem, and this was because couldn't the children have to share? my parents foresaw this and make sure that no matter, even though i was, i had the little savings. no matter how much what i had, i always learned to share. no matter how small, what the condition, whatever i had, we shared. whether it was much, whether it was little, whether it was even sufficient, we would share. we would just share it. that's one of the great moral upgrades that my parents gave me, which i'm gratefully appreciate it for. so i think we can go to the next topic now. and thank you, bayo, for your contribution, for your contribution, and i would like to cite another example. at my place of work, there used to be, there was a, an executive officer that he was. he wasn't even really into sharing. this is not really into sharing, but i mean, that's moral value and a moral value. this executive officer, whenever he sees his, yes, thank you bayo, his subordinate, it would not show the subordinate, expect the subordinate, to give greeting. he will greet before the subordinate. even though the, even though he, some others, some people will feel that i'm in a higher position. this person supposed to greet me before i greet him, and he will not greet him, and if you don't greet me, i want to make sure you pay for it. but this man, this, this officer wasn't like that. once he saw you, this, this is my, this is my, my friend, and this is my subordinate, he will greet and the person respond to him very politely. this also helped the relationship with other people, because there was even a time that. there was even a time that this man was sorry, so there was even a time that this man was. there was around his personality and his job. so it was questioned by the administrative, administrative office and the administrators. so when it was questioned, it was, it was, it was, the evidence again was against him. but when the peoples, when people heard about this, the subordinates , but when they heard about this, they were very confused that this man, this man is our friend that greet us well, how could he do such a thing. so the people, the officers were not satisfied with their, with their, what they did, what they had, they had concluded to do, to fire him or even demote him to a lower level. but when the, when i said, i mean, the subordinate were alerted, when they heard of this, they pleaded on his behalf for what he had done and they encouraged, they convinced, they successfully convinced their administrative on to, on his, his punishment, and they, they just gave me a second check, because it was not much of an offense, but they gave me a second chance and the man was not. they didn't take that from the. i also remember one of the, an instance where was, that was. when was that? anyway, i had a story from my friends that there was. no, sorry, pardon me, let me give this example. i went to one of my friends house. we both grew, we both grew up together, we've known each other since high school. so we went to, i went to his house and already he has married and given birth. so we went, we went together for like a get together party. so i met him there, and everybody was discussing, because we were many hey, lagbaja, we've not seen today, how is business, how is family, this and that, everybody discussing. in the height of all the laughter, everybody was happy relating with one another. that's when we sent for one child to get him what's the chivita pack, because he wanted to, we just ran out of chivita. so the girl wasn't happy that something conflict she had with her mom, so as soon as they grumbling, you know, the way these poor children behave, everybody was greatly appalled by her behaviour . everybody turned to i said, who just displayed that character? instantly the man was caught with shame, and my friend was caught to shame, and he said it again, in a louder voice. go do this and this, and even, she complained even louder to him. this, this, what can i say? it caught everybody's attention even more that wow? what again? then instantly, then instantly. the next time, she said it a third time. and next thing, she went up to his feet, took his slipper, and she slapped the slipper against his face. everybody was jaw dropped. i didn't even myself, i was, i didn't even know when my, literally, when my jaw just dropped. you can imagine what, how this girl had embarrassed her father, because her father couldn't teach her moral values. let me also take you to one of the time when i went to my friends home, as i got there, i had heavy load because i had heavy loads. so as i got out of my car and i greeted, when they saw me, they couldn't even greet me, his children, they couldn't greet me. they were looking at me to take, even take my bag, they couldn't. but my friend had to tell them, hey, go and take his bag now, go and take his bag. they couldn't do that. so imagine how this lack of moral values have disgraced his father. it's affecting his family because those children will never listen to him respectfully. who is this one now? who is this one now? and bayo, not only this family with this moral, lack of moral values affect, it will even affect the children's family, because they have not been taught so why would they teach their children? exactly, because it's what, and it's because, and it's what they know now that they would treat their children. they can't just get off the roof of their heads and hey, people are supposed to do. that's what i'm saying, so this is what, this is what is affecting moral values. you see how moral value is affected. that's why i'm grateful for my parents teaching that, they talked me up and they brought me up very well. thank you, bayo. so can we proceed to the second topic? yes. so bayo what are some common factors that people use to determine what is morally right or wrong? okay, now i had a very, i had a friend, she said that she was a very religious person. and when i tell you, a very religious person, i mean very religious person, it's not on the scale you think that she's, when i say religious person, i mean someone that is really, really, what can i say? not biblical, but very religious. she believed that nobody could really determine what was right or wrong, that only god could do that. you can imagine that if anybody, and if we try to determine, to what's wrong or not, we won't be coy because we are not, we are not, humans are not perfect. i quite agree, but not in that sense. so, so what she did was that she, whenever she saw that, she, whenever she thought of anything that she would tell her heart that her god, what do you want me to do? is this thing correct? is this thing right? is this thing wrong? is this thing morally correct? and this thing was quite, i must say, it was quite strange to me that what is this woman doing? it was a very odd way of going to determine what is right and wrong. yes. so let me give you another example, another thing, factor that people think to use to determine what is morally right and morally wrong. some people, some people believe that society's accepted standards of behaviour often shape people moral compass. what a society accepts this, accept that you don't do this, that you don't do that, that is what they are. they believe in their, that's what they use there, is their moral compass. this is what our society accepts. this is what our culture accept, so this is what one of the things that determines what people do. so now what about our personal concept, conscience, intuition, people just use the, this thing i'm about to do, it doesn't feel right and if it's being done to me, i wouldn't like it. you might be such a selfish. i really appreciate that. i wouldn't like it. it wouldn't do it. this thing i'm about to do, is it really good? and another thing is that a personal reflection play a role. you reflect over what you want to do that what i, look at the consequences i want to do, is it a good thing to do? can i take it from someone else? and all these things play a role in guiding individuals to discern right from wrong. so then you also look at the. some people assess the morality of an action based on its consequences. so they consider it. this is the concept of if i do this thing, this is the consequence if i don't do it. so they weigh their options, which one pays me, which one doesn't. so they do this to, aiming to maximize overall happiness and to minimize suffering. so let's look at ethical principles. philosophical frameworks such as kantian ethics, virtue ethics and social contract theory provide guidelines for determining moral behavior. so some of the things, factors that, what can i say, that, common factor that people used to determine what is morally right or wrong. thank you bayo and i also like to give some, i also like to answer that question. so, some of the factors that also determine what is morally right or morally wrong is the legal, is the legal system. because while laws may not always align perfectly with morality, they often reflect sociality, societal values and influence on individuals perceptions of right and wrong. so their perceptions of right and wrong, so most people think about legal system also part of what they used to determine the morality. for example, when you have a case, when you have a case with someone, a problem, maybe someone took your land, they said, this is where his land stop, this is where yours begins, and this is where mine starts. so when we attitude to the court, the court is not, you determine the, the outcome. yes, the outcome of the case because they will use the evidence available with them that okay, this is, this is the, for example, this is the survey of the land. so if you, i don't care, you are correct. so that's how the law uses their legal system to, to determine moral values. so, bayo, do you have anything else that you would like to say? no, i don't think so. okay but i'm just listening. one last thing. so another thing is human rights. because many people base their normal moral judgment on principles of equality, justice and the protection of fundamental rights. because even when some people, when people have their own belief, that okay, these are what i think, i believe that is correct morally, when they look at it in the eyes of this human activist, would i be correct? because of this equality will i be correct? because of the rights they claim for this, because of the rights that they claim for this person, would they like it? would they take it from me? so the person would not like to align all these beliefs with what that other person's human rights says. so, bayo, just to conclude, do you have any other thing you'd like to say? no, i don't. thank you. thank you bayo. it's a very good conversation. thank you for your contribution too. thank you.",0.5239758653540807,my name is aburio too and i consent to recording of this audio okay my name is adibayo mumumi and i consent to recording of this audio so today is topic is who or what defines morality morality is a concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on what defines it some believe that marty is determined by religious beliefs or cultural norms while others argue that it is based on personal values and principles ultimately who or what complex topic of fully influenced by combination of factors such as bringing social influences and personal experiences in this sense can be seen as a fluid and constantly evolving concept shaped by individual collective perceptions and understanding so bio what would you see is influence it is a very strict question says what would you say is to be questioned influence on your personal sense of morality one of the things that i have affected have greatly influenced my moral values that would be my upbringing you see one of the as we were growing up to the time i remember i was leaving i was conscious they were very strict about what we did us and you always think always prioritize wanted even aside religious activities that we have bringing about one of the things that you taught us so one of my advice is of life good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever i see another person you greek the person if you see somebody or that you you know are to call me according brothers who brought our face exactly on faith if it is more children than are you or daddy faith and if you are giving birth or daddy and all those simple air tickets those kind those are things those are the more values i was taught while growing up then it goes to then societal influences now when all of the things that are so the time directing fast my eh what do you call my moral my moral thing that would be my sister influences because while i was in school even if i were not taught by my parents i would see how people were relative to that people but my 0 other people were talking hey good afternoon sir when you send the including the time of the after good afternoon madam if you if you want to someone you do not even address the person even though that i want to die not to address the person so and even if i did not these things around me i was into my place i was so disarmed so so on the things that so influence my moral values thank you by the things that influenced my moral values is when i was young i even i used to i would be giving i will give something by my aunty or someone i know so when i am giving that thing maybe my my sibling will be with me and my some of it for me some children they would they would they would respond negatively that they were not going to give selfishly in a way that they used to do while they would clench their shoulder close to their cheek and they would say son so that thing used to my parents i know i grew also beyond me but when i was young my parents always taught me that when i mark or something i would give i must give i should give and even if i do not want to give i would deny and polite polite not show open your shoulder cause i think it so much that they are to they they even are to caution on children that when not they are only when they when they saw it during my life because of all these things that i have been taught whenever someone it always in my mind that it is diary i should give it someone the person is oxygen i am releasing because condition my heart is notes going to give and another thing in life is that the way that i have given people pe people give me people know this person is good that even when i give in he is going to give me and even when i give him even when he gives me i am going to give him so all that and mutual and vice versa i always continued it always help me so over to the next topic which let us go with that let me ask you so i was access something i want to do things are so that my parents taught i was growing up is that you always learn to share some other children we do not look at look at what i have i can i shot of this one thing my parents always emphasize was that little you always share they were saying to their house and neighbors they had they had they had their only child for they had about 5 minutes later that is a common the difference about 5 years so whatever the thing was both from the younger one the older one will not share the older one share because i am safe the older one wanted something you have to steal from the down one tip the thing off his hand i would take a shower walk away this was a lot of this program for the conflicts for the parents because they were always reporting issues here mom did this to me mom did is that to me you give them a lot of problem and this was because it could not get to share my parents for saw this and make sure that no matter even though i was i were i had to do it too seriously no matter how mo what i had i always learned to share no matter how small what the condition whatever i had to shared whether it was much whether it was little whether it was even sufficient that is all great mob operations that my parents which i am grateful so i think we can go to the next subject thank you contribution i would like to set down the example at at my place of work there used to be there was a an executive officer that he was he was not even really into sharing it is not really into sharing but i mean that is more value this one yes thank you by your insubordinate it would not shun his subordinates give greeting he will not greet before the subordinate even though the even though he is feel that you are i mean supposed to greet me before i greet him and greet him and if you do not greet you i want to make sure you pay for it but this man this officer was not like that it was his sorry and this this is my this is my my friend this is my son will greet and and the person who respond to him put very polite this also helped the relationship with a lot of people because there was even a time that there was even a time that sorry so there was even a time lady smile was there was actually disarm this and personality and his job so was question by the administrative administrative office and the administrative so when it was question it was it was it was evidence again was against him when did people where did people say when add about this this is it but when they add about this they were very confused this man this afraid i wish also how could he do so detail so the people the office house were not satisfied with their what they did what is their they had completed to do to fire him or even devote him to a lower level but when the when i sovereignt where that when they heard of this they they pleaded on his behalf for what he had done college they convinced they successfully convinced their administrative on to all his own punishments and someone then just gave me a 2nd chance because it was not much of an offense but they gave me a 2nd chance and their mum was not an take that from the end so i saw him by one of the stance where i was that was that anyway i understood from my friends that there was no sorry pardon me let me give this example i went to one of my friends house we brought you up together we need since i school so we went i went to my dad events together get together party so i met him there and everybody was discussing cause we are many hey says luck but today how his business obvious family stand that what is because i in the heights of all the laughter everybody was happy listen in the sense for one child to get him was to copy t v top park and of course wanted to we just run out of chivita so i the guy was not half hurry halfway dust because with something coffee shop with our mom so i soon actually there grumbling ya me ya the way that these 4 children behave everybody was really appalled by i have been everybody told us lah who does it started my mom was caught with sham was called to sham and he said it again go this in the louder voice gondos and again yeah even even what kind of complaint even louder this this fam this fair what can i say it is called everybody after shady moon models wah again again then instantly what she said is a tall time and after the other she went up to she took a step as he slapped his face everybody was jaw dropped i need myself i was i do not know where my my george dropped you can imagine what how does get at them i asked our father because i put out let me take it to one time when i went to my friend to my friend i got i got there i had every loose because i did every loads i got out of my canal and i greeted when they saw they could not even greet me children they could not greet in the world looking at me take it would take one by they could not at least my friend out to tell them hey take his bag now go and take his bag they could not do that so imagine how this lack of moral values are disgraced because those children will never listen to him respectfully was this one exactly is what they know now that they would teach our children you can not just get out of you of you for their he is a hey he was supposed to do so i am what is affecting moral values affected that is why i am wishing for my parents and i did talk and it brought me so called yes so what factors that people use to determine what is my okay now i do i do friend she said that she was a very religious person and when i tell you very i mean very religious person it is not only skilled you think that she is going to trust just as i mean someone that can i see bipart very religious she believed that nobody could really determine what was right or wrong god could do that you can imagine that if anybody to draw it because i know it is not it was not all perfect i quite agree well not in that sense what she did that she would she saw that she actually talked about it and she would tell our heart of how god what you want me to do what is correct correct what this day was quite i must say it was quite strange to me that what is this woman doing it was a very odd way of determining what is right or wrong yes so let me give another example another factor that people think to use you to deter what is my right i do not some people believe that societies set standards of beavio ship people is moran post society sept that you do not do this that you do not do that that is what they believe in that need this is what our society accepts these with our cultural asset so this is what it is that people do so now that conscious conscious intuition who does you do it about to do it does not feel right if it is being done to me i would not like it why this sort of suffered i really appreciate that i would not like it i would not do it but this time about to do is really good and a personal reflection play role you reflect over what you want to do that what i am doing the consequences wrong i want to do would it is it a good thing to do can i take it from someone else you and gear i am seeing and the only thing is play a role in gannivar individuals discern right from wrong so then you also look id some people i says to marty of an action based on its consequences so consider that this is a cost if i do not so they wait out shows which of pays me which one does not so they do this to amy to my demise well happiness and to me and suffering so principles it does typical framework such as concerts virtue ethics and social contract theory provide guidelines for disarming moral behavior so on it is artist that people used to tell me what is my right thank you i also like to give that question so some of the factors does so did tell me what is the guy is a legal system because while laws may not always align perfectly with moral reflect social values and influence on individuals perceptions of rights so sorry so and their perceptions of right and wrong so they are part of what they used to determine for example when you have a case where someone a problem disease lunch so this is where yours begins and this is where my stance and israel so when the attitude to the court the court is not determined because they will use the evidence and they this is the this is the soviet of the law so you are okay you are correct so that is our legal system to determine more values so bio do you have anything else that you would like to say one thing so i am not in many people busy judgments principles of equality justice and the potential of what i because even where people have their own what i think i believe when they look at it in the eyes of this human activists will i be correct because of the sequoyah because of the rights they played for the president would they like it would they take it from me so person would not like to live all these bees with what that is human rights sees so bios you have a lot to see i mean thank you thank you for a good thank you for your contribution,my name is abulorin otu and i consent to recording of this audio okay my name is adebayo omowunmi and i consent to the recording of this audio so today is topic is who or what defines morality morality is a concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on what defines it some believe that morality is determined by religious beliefs or cultural norms while others argue that it is based on personal values and principles ultimately who or what defines morality ultimately the who or what defines morality is a complex and subjective topic often influenced by a combination of factors such as upbringing societal influences and personal experiences in this sense mortality can be morality can be seen as a fluid and constantly evolving concept shaped by individuals and collective perceptions and understandings so bayo what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality okay this is quite a tricky question says that what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality well one of the things that i have affected that have greatly influenced my moral values that would be my upbringing you see one of the as we were growing up at least up to the time i remember i was living i was conscious but i remember my parents they were very strict about what we did our behavior to ourselves and to others and they always think about and they always prioritize one thing even aside our education and our religious activities that we have good that we had good upbringing number 11 of the things that they taught us so when in my early stages of life good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever you see an elderly person you greet the person if you see if you see somebody older than you you know how to call him maybe you call him brother so so so brother brother faith exactly uncle faith if he is much older than you or daddy faith depending on if he has given birth or daddy and all those simple etiquettes those can those are things those are the moral values i was taught while growing up then it goes to then we talk about societal influences now when one of the things that also the time directly influence my for us what they call my moral my morality that would be my social influences because while i was in school even if i were not taught by my parents i would see how people were relating to other people my younger people would talk to me hey good afternoon sir when you see another person greeting the time of day good afternoon ma good afternoon madam if you want to be someone you do not know even his name you know how to address the person and if you sorry and if and when you see somebody even older than you want you know how to address the person so and even if i did not like i said even if i did not see all these things around me i was i went to my place i was all these things around me so some of the things that influence my moral my moral values so thank you bayo but i also like the take something on that all of the things that influenced my moral values is when i was young when i used to grow up i would be given i will be given something by many of my uncle or my auntie or someone i know so when i am given that thing maybe my my sibling will be with me and he will ask some of some of it for me some children that were not well brought up they would respond negatively that they were not going to give selfishly in a way that they used to do while we were young they would have clench their shoulder close to their cheek and they will say son so that thing used to irritate my parents and when i grow also began to irritate me but when i was young my parents always taught me that when i asked or something i will give i must give i should give and even if i do not want to give i would deny polite in a polite manner not show up in your shoulder because that irritated them so much that they had to they even had to caution some children that were not there or even when they when they saw it and what we done in my life because of all these things that i have been taught whenever someone asks me for something it is always on my mind that it it is that i should give it but as someone the person is asking i am releasing it because i have conditioned my heart that once someone asks you are going to give and another thing in life is that the way that i have given people given people that this person is good that even when i have given him he is going to give me and even when i give him even when he gives me i am going to give him so all that mutual and vice versa cycle has always continued in my life and it has always helped me in my moral values so over to the next topic which is wait let us not go dancing yes let me i have something to add so i will also ask you something now one of the things also that my parents taught me growing up is that we always learn to share some other children will just look at it that look at what i have how can i share out of it but one thing my parents always emphasize was that no matter how little or no matter how big it is you always share there was certain children in our house and neighbors they had they had they had an only child for the child was about 5 but 5 years later they had the 2nd born the difference was about 5 years so whenever they think they were born from the younger one the older one will not share the younger one was share because and so if the other one wanted something you have to steal from the other one maybe they take the thing off his hand so only you take your share and walk away this caused a lot of this problem for the conflicts for the parents because they were always reporting issues hey mom this this did to me hey mom this did that to me it gave them a lot of problem and this was because could not the children have to share my parents foresaw this and make sure that no matter even though i was i had the little savings no matter how much what i had i always learned to share no matter how small what the condition whatever i had we shared whether it was much whether it was little whether it was even sufficient we would share we would just share it that is one of the great moral upgrades that my parents gave me which i am gratefully appreciate it for so i think we can go to the next topic now and thank you bayo for your contribution for your contribution and i would like to cite another example at my place of work there used to be there was a an executive officer that he was he was not even really into sharing this is not really into sharing but i mean that is moral value and a moral value this executive officer whenever he sees his yes thank you bayo his subordinate it would not show the subordinate expect the subordinate to give greeting he will greet before the subordinate even though the even though he some others some people will feel that i am in a higher position this person supposed to greet me before i greet him and he will not greet him and if you do not greet me i want to make sure you pay for it but this man this this officer was not like that once he saw you this this is my this is my my friend and this is my subordinate he will greet and the person respond to him very politely this also helped the relationship with other people because there was even a time that there was even a time that this man was sorry so there was even a time that this man was there was around his personality and his job so it was questioned by the administrative administrative office and the administrators so when it was questioned it was it was it was the evidence again was against him but when the peoples when people heard about this the subordinates but when they heard about this they were very confused that this man this man is our friend that greet us well how could he do such a thing so the people the officers were not satisfied with their with their what they did what they had they had concluded to do to fire him or even demote him to a lower level but when the when i said i mean the subordinate were alerted when they heard of this they pleaded on his behalf for what he had done and they encouraged they convinced they successfully convinced their administrative on to on his his punishment and they they just gave me a 2nd check because it was not much of an offense but they gave me a 2nd chance and the man was not they did not take that from the i also remember one of the an instance where was that was when was that anyway i had a story from my friends that there was no sorry pardon me let me give this example i went to one of my friends house we both grew we both grew up together we have known each other since high school so we went to i went to his house and already he has married and given birth so we went we went together for like a get together party so i met him there and everybody was discussing because we were many hey lagbaja we have not seen today how is business how is family this and that everybody discussing in the height of all the laughter everybody was happy relating with one another that is when we sent for one child to get him what is the chivita pack because he wanted to we just ran out of chivita so the girl was not happy that something conflict she had with her mom so as soon as they grumbling you know the way these poor children behave everybody was greatly appalled by her behavior everybody turned to i said who just displayed that character instantly the man was caught with shame and my friend was caught to shame and he said it again in a louder voice go do this and this and even she complained even louder to him this this what can i say it caught everybody is attention even more that wow what again then instantly then instantly the next time she said it a 3rd time and next thing she went up to his feet took his slipper and she slapped the slipper against his face everybody was jaw dropped i did not even myself i was i did not even know when my literally when my jaw just dropped you can imagine what how this girl had embarrassed her father because her father could not teach her moral values let me also take you to one of the time when i went to my friends home as i got there i had heavy load because i had heavy loads so as i got out of my car and i greeted when they saw me they could not even greet me his children they could not greet me they were looking at me to take even take my bag they could not but my friend had to tell them hey go and take his bag now go and take his bag they could not do that so imagine how this lack of moral values have disgraced his father it is affecting his family because those children will never listen to him respectfully who is this one now who is this one now and bayo not only this family with this moral lack of moral values affect it will even affect the children is family because they have not been taught so why would they teach their children exactly because it is what and it is because and it is what they know now that they would treat their children they can not just get off the roof of their heads and hey people are supposed to do that is what i am saying so this is what this is what is affecting moral values you see how moral value is affected that is why i am grateful for my parents teaching that they talked me up and they brought me up very well thank you bayo so can we proceed to the 2nd topic yes so bayo what are some common factors that people use to determine what is morally right or wrong okay now i had a very i had a friend she said that she was a very religious person and when i tell you a very religious person i mean very religious person it is not on the scale you think that she is when i say religious person i mean someone that is really really what can i say not biblical but very religious she believed that nobody could really determine what was right or wrong that only god could do that you can imagine that if anybody and if we try to determine to what is wrong or not we will not be coy because we are not we are not humans are not perfect i quite agree but not in that sense so so what she did was that she whenever she saw that she whenever she thought of anything that she would tell her heart that her god what do you want me to do is this thing correct is this thing right is this thing wrong is this thing morally correct and this thing was quite i must say it was quite strange to me that what is this woman doing it was a very odd way of going to determine what is right and wrong yes so let me give you another example another thing factor that people think to use to determine what is morally right and morally wrong some people some people believe that society is accepted standards of behavior often shape people moral compass what a society accepts this accept that you do not do this that you do not do that that is what they are they believe in their that is what they use there is their moral compass this is what our society accepts this is what our culture accept so this is what one of the things that determines what people do so now what about our personal concept conscience intuition people just use the this thing i am about to do it does not feel right and if it is being done to me i would not like it you might be such a selfish i really appreciate that i would not like it it would not do it this thing i am about to do is it really good and another thing is that a personal reflection play a role you reflect over what you want to do that what i look at the consequences i want to do is it a good thing to do can i take it from someone else and all these things play a role in guiding individuals to discern right from wrong so then you also look at the some people assess the morality of an action based on its consequences so they consider it this is the concept of if i do this thing this is the consequence if i do not do it so they weigh their options which one pays me which one does not so they do this to aiming to maximize overall happiness and to minimize suffering so let us look at ethical principles philosophical frameworks such as kantian ethics virtue ethics and social contract theory provide guidelines for determining moral behavior so some of the things factors that what can i say that common factor that people used to determine what is morally right or wrong thank you bayo and i also like to give some i also like to answer that question so some of the factors that also determine what is morally right or morally wrong is the legal is the legal system because while laws may not always align perfectly with morality they often reflect sociality societal values and influence on individuals perceptions of right and wrong so their perceptions of right and wrong so most people think about legal system also part of what they used to determine the morality for example when you have a case when you have a case with someone a problem maybe someone took your land they said this is where his land stop this is where yours begins and this is where mine starts so when we attitude to the court the court is not you determine the the outcome yes the outcome of the case because they will use the evidence available with them that okay this is this is the for example this is the survey of the land so if you i do not care you are correct so that is how the law uses their legal system to to determine moral values so bayo do you have anything else that you would like to say no i do not think so okay but i am just listening one last thing so another thing is human rights because many people base their normal moral judgment on principles of equality justice and the protection of fundamental rights because even when some people when people have their own belief that okay these are what i think i believe that is correct morally when they look at it in the eyes of this human activist would i be correct because of this equality will i be correct because of the rights they claim for this because of the rights that they claim for this person would they like it would they take it from me so the person would not like to align all these beliefs with what that other person is human rights says so bayo just to conclude do you have any other thing you would like to say no i do not thank you thank you bayo it is a very good conversation thank you for your contribution too thank you

I consent to recording this conversation. Hi, my name is Murphy Victor. I consent to recording this conversation. All right, Victor Murphy, you are welcome to today's discussion. We will be talking about a very common practice these days, which was not there in the olden days, that came along with the introduction of Internet, something called online shopping. Victor, I know it's a very familiar word with you, because looking at you is very obvious that you are a new generation man. You are a 21st century man. Yes. So, Victor, can you please, a few words, explain to me what you understand as online shopping. Online shopping is very basic, is a. Is very easy to understand. It's basically the purchase of items, goods and how should I say, services too, because services are also included online, where you make the payments online and the goods are then delivered to you at your home, at the place of your convenience, either to your postal office or sometimes a home delivery. But everything, every transaction, the bargaining and everything is done online. Okay, so Victor, what you're saying is that online shopping is when somebody makes purchases online and they deliver the product to them in their place of residence. Yes. And sometimes it's not only are about goods, it can equally be services. Yes. Ok, that is very nice point, Victor, can I know if you have patronized online shopping before? Yes, about a few months back, I was in need of a phone. Okay. So I tried physical shopping for the phone, but the phone I wanted to buy was not available in my country, and the only way to get the phone was through a website, which is very popular, Aliexpress. Okay, so the Aliexpress only does is an online shopping platform. So in order to get the phone, I had to engage myself in online shopping actively, and then that was how I got the phone to my country. So, yes, I can proudly say that I've tried online part online shopping in the past and I still do to date. Okay, so what you are saying is that you bought your current fine phone that you're using right now online. Yes. From an international site called Aliexpress. Yes. Okay, Victor, is there any reason why you didn't buy from the local, the online shopping, or do you just prefer the one of international? No, that's one advantage online shopping has over physical shopping. Okay. Physical shopping is limited to the wares that the owner has. Okay. Online shopping gives you a variety, because online shopping opens your world of, like, the ability to be able to even purchase, like, different varieties of goods, even from the people making the goods themselves. Some of the people making the goods can actually, like, allow you to buy directly from them via online shopping. But these people that sell physically, they may not have different varieties of the goods because obviously they have, they, they work on a profit margin where they have to sell exactly what the market needs, their locality needs. So if they bring in goods and goods that their locality does not actually need, they'll make a loss. They will not sell that product. So they are supplied. The amount, the variety of goods they have in their physical stores is limited. So that's one advantage of online shopping. Okay, so what you're saying is that people who sell in physical store has a limited stock, stock amount of goods that they will sell. And online shopping also gives you ability to choose from different vendors. Is that what you mean? Yes. Yes. Okay. Victor, can I know if you had any problem shopping online before? I'll not say I actually had a problem, but I had phobia or fear. Fear? Ok Not phobia of trying it out, but phobia that I have tried it out because my goods took time to actually come to me. Okay. So I had this fear that it might get lost or something might, bad might happen to it or it may get delivered to a wrong location. But aside that I don't have any problem with online shopping, but eventually the good later got delivered. So. Got delivered to you? Yes. Can I know if the goods was good or was it spoilt? Because I do hear that sometimes people get their goods spoilt on the way while or like on the transit, when they are group their goods is still in transit, it gets spoilt or lost or something. Was your own like that? Yeah, it was in perfect condition. Okay. It was in perfect conditions. So if you're giving a chance again or. You will still shop more online or will you still like to shop more online? Obviously. Obviously. Obviously. So what you are saying? I like the ease with online shopping. I'll obviously try it again next time. Speaker 1]: Okay. With the ease, you tend to enjoy shopping online more? Yes. How about the price difference? Don't you consider the fact that the price of offline market will be cheaper than the price of online marketing? It's subjective, but from my own experience is online shopping. Online shopping, most times the pricing is way lower than the pricing in the local markets. Most times, most times. Because not all shoppers do this. Not all. Sorry, not all market sellers do this, but some of them do shop for their goods online. Okay. And when they now shop their goods online, they now sell it at a higher price than the actual price. than the actual price. So if you can get access to the online vendors that they're buying it from, you can actually get it at the real original price without the added fee. Yeah. So most times, shopping online can be cheaper than shopping in your local stores. Yes. So what you're saying is that online can be cheaper sometimes because you tend to get the goods from the original supplier, not from the retailers? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, that's very wonderful, Victor. Victor, can I know if you have any specific amount of goods that you can buy online or you can purchase any amount. You know, there are people that used to say that, I can't spend less than 10,000 or less than 100,000 online. Do you think you can purchase a product of up to a million naira online? Yes. Many people have that fear of purchasing online unless you are dealing with a website. You know, online shopping, you don't just. Online shopping is not just one shop. There are different, different websites selling stuff online. So they are amongst this websites there are trusted website in which they already have a track record of delivering goods to their customers, to their customer base. So those kind of websites, you are in 100% safe hands because they have measures in which that if you ever buy your goods and something bad happens along the way, you can always contact them and you can always have a way to get your goods back or something like that. So because of that security, spending a lot of money online doing online shopping is not actually a big problem because you are in safe hands if you go with the right trusted, vendors. Okay. Okay. So what you're trying to say is that you are very comfortable with shopping online, no matter the amount of money, once it is a reputable online market. Yes, online shop. Yes. Okay. Okay. That's a very interesting one, Victor. I do hope I join to shop online very soon. Now, if people ask you, do you advise them to really shop online or shop offline? Okay, online shopping is actually very enjoyable because, one, you don't have to like. You don't have to, you don't have to like. There's so many things that are in my mind. So that's why I'm just trying, taking my time to actually go through the thought process. You, there's more convenience because you can actually sit in your home and just click a button and get your stuff ordered to you. You understand? You don't have to actually leave and go to the crowded markets where you'll be struggling with other. Struggling with other shoppers. And you, you, yes, you get frustrated by the environment of the market. You know, how busy markets are now and how frustrating can. And sometimes looking for the item you want in a physical shop in a physical market can be quite stressful, especially if the market is big and you have to walk from one place to another to another. And sometimes, even though you go to the right place, sometimes they may not have the goods you want. Online shopping, most of these online shopping platforms, they made it very easy for you to find the thing you want. All you have to do is just do, just do a little magic with your keyboard, go to the search bar, type the thing you are looking for, and then you get a list, not just one of the item you want, you get a variety of the item you want and you can, at your own convenience, at your bed, even at your bed, choose the item you want and then just make your purchase very easy and fast, and then get your stuff delivered at the most convenient time. Wow. Wow. That is very interesting, Victor. So what you're saying is that with online shopping, you don't have to pass through the hassle of meeting a lot of people in the market and those walking around, especially in the very large market where you have to trek from one shop to another and make inquiries. But with online shopping, you can just click log into the site and just scroll and pick whatever thing you want without really meeting the seller. I believe you're this type of person that doesn't like all those cat calls that you get from the sellers. Yeah, yeah, that's very important. Fine boy, come here. Fine girl. What do you want? What do you want? I have it. I have it. Even when they don't, they don't know what you're looking for, but they're already shouting, fine girl, come, come, come. Well, Victor, you have a very solid point. I really agree with you that, shopping online is very interesting. Okay, so it's very, very interesting. But, I, I do hope that we in Nigeria get a strong shopping online platform because I've had a very bad experience where I, I was able to experience this common wish that they call, what I ordered versus what I got. Because there was a time I got a product and it was a product that has been, tampered with. I felt very bad. So that really discouraged me for some time from ordering from that site. So, but with your analysis these days, I think I will, I will try again to reconsider shopping online. Yeah, you should. You'll actually enjoy it. Speaker 1]: Even though it gives a big man vibes. I hope I become a bigger man very soon so I can be able to spend millions of Naira You'll get there. Without really leaving the comfort of my zone because comfort of my home, because right now, everybody is looking for comfort. Whichever way you can give people comfort, they are ready to give you money. So online shopping to me is also interesting. According to how you described it, I can stay at my home and order. Would you like to tell my audience something else before we end the discussion? Victor, I have been enjoying your gist for some minutes now. For over 13 minutes. Yeah. I just want to point out some disadvantages of online shopping. Okay. Outside the advantages of convenience and cheaper prices. Though online shopping is actually enjoyable and convenient and gives you variety of goods to choose from. Okay. One of the most like annoying part of online shopping, I'll not say it annoying to some, its annoying to some. To some, It's not annoying, but it's a con. Yeah. Its delayed delivery. Oh, yes. Like in, unlike physical shores where items can be given to you immediately. This one, you have to wait for some time, some time for your stuff to be delayed to you. Then another one is weeks of fraud if you fall in the hands of the fraudulent vendors. Okay. So that's why I always suggest that you should go with reputable stores online. You should not just shop with anyone. The fact that you cannot bargain price. Speaker 1]: Yes. You can bargain with some vendors. Yes. Like some, some do allow you to bargain, but most don't allow you to bargain. Especially the ones that are like websites. Yes. One page websites and those kind of ones that the price now already be set. You have to only be. The only way to make payments is just slot in your credit card and pay. But some do allow you, especially if some of them are vendors that use social media accounts. You can actually bargain and chat with them. But most of them that are like big shops, shopping website like Aliexpress, Jumia and the rest, you know, the names, they don't allow you to bargain. I think that's all. That's all I want. Victor, thank you so much for this, your wonderful contribution. I really appreciate giving me your busy time tonight. Thank you, Victor. Yeah, glad having you.",hello my name is chezoba i consent to recording this conversation hi my name is mufi victor i consent to recording this conversation alright victor mufe you are welcome to

yes. can i know if the goods was good or was it spoilt? because i do hear that sometimes people get their goods spoilt on the way while or like on the transit, when they are group their goods is still in transit, it gets spoilt or lost or something. was your own like that? yeah, it was in perfect condition. okay. it was in perfect conditions. so if you're giving a chance again or. you will still shop more online or will you still like to shop more online? obviously. obviously. obviously. so what you are saying? i like the ease with online shopping. i'll obviously try it again next time. speaker 1]: okay. with the ease, you tend to enjoy shopping online more? yes. how about the price difference? don't you consider the fact that the price of offline market will be cheaper than the price of online marketing? it's subjective, but from my own experience is online shopping. online shopping, most times the pricing is way lower than the pricing in the local markets. most times, most times. because not all shoppers do this. not all. sorry, not all market sellers do this, but some of them do shop for their goods online. okay. and when they now shop their goods online, they now sell it at a higher price than the actual price. than the actual price. so if you can get access to the online vendors that they're buying it from, you can actually get it at the real original price without the added fee. yeah. so most times, shopping online can be cheaper than shopping in your local stores. yes. so what you're saying is that online can be cheaper sometimes because you tend to get the goods from the original supplier, not from the retailers? yes, yes, yes. oh, that's very wonderful, victor. victor, can i know if you have any specific amount of goods that you can buy online or you can purchase any amount. you know, there are people that used to say that, i can't spend less than 10,000 or less than 100,000 online. do you think you can purchase a product of up to a million naira online? yes. many people have that fear of purchasing online unless you are dealing with a website. you know, online shopping, you don't just. online shopping is not just one shop. there are different, different websites selling stuff online. so they are amongst this websites there are trusted website in which they already have a track record of delivering goods to their customers, to their customer base. so those kind of websites, you are in 100% safe hands because they have measures in which that if you ever buy your goods and something bad happens along the way, you can always contact them and you can always have a way to get your goods back or something like that. so because of that security, spending a lot of money online doing online shopping is not actually a big problem because you are in safe hands if you go with the right trusted, vendors. okay. okay. so what you're trying to say is that you are very comfortable with shopping online, no matter the amount of money, once it is a reputable online market. yes, online shop. yes. okay. okay. that's a very interesting one, victor. i do hope i join to shop online very soon. now, if people ask you, do you advise them to really shop online or shop offline? okay, online shopping is actually very enjoyable because, one, you don't have to like. you don't have to, you don't have to like. there's so many things that are in my mind. so that's why i'm just trying, taking my time to actually go through the thought process. you, there's more convenience because you can actually sit in your home and just click a button and get your stuff ordered to you. you understand? you don't have to actually leave and go to the crowded markets where you'll be struggling with other. struggling with other shoppers. and you, you, yes, you get frustrated by the environment of the market. you know, how busy markets are now and how frustrating can. and sometimes looking for the item you want in a physical shop in a physical market can be quite stressful, especially if the market is big and you have to walk from one place to another to another. and sometimes, even though you go to the right place, sometimes they may not have the goods you want. online shopping, most of these online shopping platforms, they made it very easy for you to find the thing you want. all you have to do is just do, just do a little magic with your keyboard, go to the search bar, type the thing you are looking for, and then you get a list, not just one of the item you want, you get a variety of the item you want and you can, at your own convenience, at your bed, even at your bed, choose the item you want and then just make your purchase very easy and fast, and then get your stuff delivered at the most convenient time. wow. wow. that is very interesting, victor. so what you're saying is that with online shopping, you don't have to pass through the hassle of meeting a lot of people in the market and those walking around, especially in the very large market where you have to trek from one shop to another and make inquiries. but with online shopping, you can just click log into the site and just scroll and pick whatever thing you want without really meeting the seller. i believe you're this type of person that doesn't like all those cat calls that you get from the sellers. yeah, yeah, that's very important. fine boy, come here. fine girl. what do you want? what do you want? i have it. i have it. even when they don't, they don't know what you're looking for, but they're already shouting, fine girl, come, come, come. well, victor, you have a very solid point. i really agree with you that, shopping online is very interesting. okay, so it's very, very interesting. but, i, i do hope that we in nigeria get a strong shopping online platform because i've had a very bad experience where i, i was able to experience this common wish that they call, what i ordered versus what i got. because there was a time i got a product and it was a product that has been, tampered with. i felt very bad. so that really discouraged me for some time from ordering from that site. so, but with your analysis these days, i think i will, i will try again to reconsider shopping online. yeah, you should. you'll actually enjoy it. speaker 1]: even though it gives a big man vibes. i hope i become a bigger man very soon so i can be able to spend millions of naira you'll get there. without really leaving the comfort of my zone because comfort of my home, because right now, everybody is looking for comfort. whichever way you can give people comfort, they are ready to give you money. so online shopping to me is also interesting. according to how you described it, i can stay at my home and order. would you like to tell my audience something else before we end the discussion? victor, i have been enjoying your gist for some minutes now. for over 13 minutes. yeah. i just want to point out some disadvantages of online shopping. okay. outside the advantages of convenience and cheaper prices. though online shopping is actually enjoyable and convenient and gives you variety of goods to choose from. okay. one of the most like annoying part of online shopping, i'll not say it annoying to some, its annoying to some. to some, it's not annoying, but it's a con. yeah. its delayed delivery. oh, yes. like in, unlike physical shores where items can be given to you immediately. this one, you have to wait for some time, some time for your stuff to be delayed to you. then another one is weeks of fraud if you fall in the hands of the fraudulent vendors. okay. so that's why i always suggest that you should go with reputable stores online. you should not just shop with anyone. the fact that you cannot bargain price. speaker 1]: yes. you can bargain with some vendors. yes. like some, some do allow you to bargain, but most don't allow you to bargain. especially the ones that are like websites. yes. one page websites and those kind of ones that the price now already be set. you have to only be. the only way to make payments is just slot in your credit card and pay. but some do allow you, especially if some of them are vendors that use social media accounts. you can actually bargain and chat with them. but most of them that are like big shops, shopping website like aliexpress, jumia and the rest, you know, the names, they don't allow you to bargain. i think that's all. that's all i want. victor, thank you so much for this, your wonderful contribution. i really appreciate giving me your busy time tonight. thank you, victor. yeah, glad having you.",0.2989601386481802,hello my name is chezoba i consent to recording this conversation hi my name is mufi victor i consent to recording this

My name is Nana Firdausi and I am giving my consent for this audio to be recorded. Good morning. My name is Aisha and I give my consent for this audio to be recorded. So today I would like to discuss a topic with you. The topic is happiness versus peace. So overview happiness and peace are two concepts that are often used interchangeably but have distinct differences. Happiness is a subjective emotional state that is often associated with experiencing joy, pleasure, and satisfaction. It is a temporary and fleeting feeling that can be easily influenced by external factors such as relationships, achievements, and material possessions. On the other hand, peace is a state of mind that is characterized by inner calm, contentment, and harmony. It is not dependent on external factors, but rather a sense of inner security and acceptance. Peace is a long term state of being that is not easily influenced by temporary events or circumstances. In essence, happiness is a momentary emotion while peace is a state of being. While both are desirable goals, It is important to understand that happiness and peace are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to experience both simultaneously, but ones pursuit of happiness should not be prioritized over finding inner peace and balance in life. Sample discussion prompts: I was reading an article on happiness and it mentioned how some people prioritize peace over happiness. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think it is possible to have both at the same time? Let me know what you think. Okay, thank you very much for this question. To be very honest, I think peace should be prioritized over happiness first, because I feel as humans, we have these fake crazy standards or definition of what we think happiness is. For instance, a lot of us don't see happiness as the very little things we tend to associate it with financial stability, an obsession with success just for us to feel among, or, you know, just for the fake standards set by the society. Like, oh, you are a lawyer, so you have made it in life. Oh, you are a doctor, so your life is made. So, as I've said earlier, for me, I will prioritize peace because peace is a state of being, just like you said in the introduction. Like, yes, I have made peace with myself not to get obsessed with success so much that will destroy me. I am. I have made peace with myself that I will find happiness in the very little things in my life. And for us to attain. Or let me say, for me to attain peace in my life, there's one very big thing I removed. It is envy or looking at someone else's pace in life like, ah, my friends are graduating, but me, I still have a spill. I have one year left. Once you start thinking about things like that, you will not have peace in your life because it will lead to envy, it will lead to jealousy, it will lead to hatred. You might even destroy your happiness in the process. So overall, I believe peace can be attained once you have conquered your mind to achieve it. And for someone that have found peace, happiness is not far from your reach at all. You are definitely going to find happiness. So, thank you. That's what I think. Yeah, I agree with you. Because personally, I think once you've found peace, happiness is not really out of your reach. Because, you know, to me, peace is, Whether this thing happens or not, I am okay with it. I am satisfied. Peace is more about satisfaction.You know, the point of making your. Mind or your soul feel relaxed, like you're bothered. Peace is not about being okay. Let me give you an example. I am bidding for a contract. Whether I get the contract or not, I have made peace with myself that. I won't let it bother me, but, Rather, if I get it, yeah, I will be grateful to God. I will, you know, appreciate my own efforts and be grateful to God. But if I don't get the contract, I am going to try again or see where the problem is. That is what I just feel Peace is all about. While happiness is just this crazy obsession of you perfecting your life, which is, you know, nearly impossible. So the first step to finding happiness is finding peace. So I'm going to be asking you the next question now. I've always believed that true happiness comes from inner peace. But I know some people who chase after happiness constantly. What do you think is more important, finding happiness or finding peace? Let me know what you think. So, as I've said earlier, me personally, I think happiness is not something that needs to be constantly chased if you've not attained inner peace. Because that is just you setting yourself up for destruction, I'm sorry to say. Why? There's no harm in chasing happiness. We should be careful about ways in which we chase happiness and put, you know, into consideration that we don't always get what we want in life. Except that some people use other means, of course, illegal means, to get them sometimes, which, you know, leads to their destruction. And ultimately it leads to them being temporarily happy or from being temporarily happy to be unhappy for life. So I rather people set their goals straight by them finding inner peace. Then go ahead to pursue happiness while being peaceful at heart. To be able to live a healthy and a truly fulfilling happy life. In conclusion, peace is what will give a man true happiness, and not just an illusion or temporary happiness. So the step is finding peace. You have to find peace to find true happiness. And that's what I think. That's final. Thank you very much for allowing me to speak. Wow, you've, You've made a lot of sense to me, too. I think you have to find peace to be truly happy in life. And I hope we all find peace and. Or let's say I hope we all make peace with whatever is going on in our lives. Because after finding peace, then happiness should not be difficult to find. Though I think peace is. Peace does not, Peace does not necessarily mean you're happy. It's just mean, Whether this works out or not, you choose to be at peace. Like, you are not bothered, you're not disturbed about whatever is going on, you know, in your life. So, yeah, I hope we all find peace and happiness in our lives. Thank you very much for having this conversation with Thanks you You are welcome. No problem. All right. Have a nice day.

like to discuss a topic you topic is happiness peace overview happiness and peace concept often used interchangeably but have distinct differences happiness is a subjective emotional state that is often associated with experiencing joy pleasure and satisfaction it is a temporary and fleeting feeling that can be easily influenced by external factors such as relationships achievements and material possessions on the other hand peace is a state of mind that is characterized by inner calm contentment and harmony it is not dependent on external factors but rather a sense of inner security

have a nice day bye,"good morning. my name is nana firdausi and i am giving my consent for this audio to be recorded. good morning. my name is aisha and i give my consent for this audio to be recorded. so today i would like to discuss a topic with you. the topic is happiness versus peace. so overview happiness and peace are two concepts that are often used interchangeably but have distinct differences. happiness is a subjective emotional state that is often associated with experiencing joy, pleasure, and satisfaction. it is a temporary and fleeting feeling that can be easily influenced by external factors such as relationships, achievements, and material possessions. on the other hand, peace is a state of mind that is characterized by inner calm, contentment, and harmony. it is not dependent on external factors, but rather a sense of inner security and acceptance. peace is a long term state of being that is not easily influenced by temporary events or circumstances. in essence, happiness is a momentary emotion while peace is a state of being. while both are desirable goals, it is important to understand that happiness and peace are not mutually exclusive. it is possible to experience both simultaneously, but ones pursuit of happiness should not be prioritized over finding inner peace and balance in life. sample discussion prompts: i was reading an article on happiness and it mentioned how some people prioritize peace over happiness. what are your thoughts on this? do you think it is possible to have both at the same time? let me know what you think. okay, thank you very much for this question. to be very honest, i think peace should be prioritized over happiness first, because i feel as humans, we have these fake crazy standards or definition of what we think happiness is. for instance, a lot of us don't see happiness as the very little things we tend to associate it with financial stability, an obsession with success just for us to feel among, or, you know, just for the fake standards set by the society. like, oh, you are a lawyer, so you have made it in life. oh, you are a doctor, so your life is made. so, as i've said earlier, for me, i will prioritize peace because peace is a state of being, just like you said in the introduction. like, yes, i have made peace with myself not to get obsessed with success so much that will destroy me. i am. i have made peace with myself that i will find happiness in the very little things in my life. and for us to attain. or let me say, for me to attain peace in my life, there's one very big thing i removed. it is envy or looking at someone else's pace in life like, ah, my friends are graduating, but me, i still have a spill. i have one year left. once you start thinking about things like that, you will not have peace in your life because it will lead to envy, it will lead to jealousy, it will lead to hatred. you might even destroy your happiness in the process. so overall, i believe peace can be attained once you have conquered your mind to achieve it. and for someone that have found peace, happiness is not far from your reach at all. you are definitely going to find happiness. so, thank you. that's what i think. yeah, i agree with you. because personally, i think once you've found peace, happiness is not really out of your reach. because, you know, to me, peace is, whether this thing happens or not, i am okay with it. i am satisfied. peace is more about satisfaction.you know, the point of making your. mind or your soul feel relaxed, like you're bothered. peace is not about being okay. let me give you an example. i am bidding for a contract. whether i get the contract or not, i have made peace with myself that. i won't let it bother me, but, rather, if i get it, yeah, i will be grateful to god. i will, you know, appreciate my own efforts and be grateful to god. but if i don't get the contract, i am going to try again or see where the problem is. that is what i just feel peace is all about. while happiness is just this crazy obsession of you perfecting your life, which is, you know, nearly impossible. so the first step to finding happiness is finding peace. so i'm going to be asking you the next question now. i've always believed that true happiness comes from inner peace. but i know some people who chase after happiness constantly. what do you think is more important, finding happiness or finding peace? let me know what you think. so, as i've said earlier, me personally, i think happiness is not something that needs to be constantly chased if you've not attained inner peace. because that is just you setting yourself up for destruction, i'm sorry to say. why? there's no harm in chasing happiness. we should be careful about ways in which we chase happiness and put, you know, into consideration that we don't always get what we want in life. except that some people use other means, of course, illegal means, to get them sometimes, which, you

finding inner peace. then go ahead to pursue happiness while being peaceful at heart. to be able to live a healthy and a truly fulfilling happy life. in conclusion, peace is what will give a man true happiness, and not just an illusion or temporary happiness. so the step is finding peace. you have to find peace to find true happiness. and that's what i think. that's final. thank you very much for allowing me to speak. wow, you've, you've made a lot of sense to me, too. i think you have to find peace to be truly happy in life. and i hope we all find peace and. or let's say i hope we all make

My name is precious Omotosho and I consent to the recording of this audio. Okay, so today's topic is the church, state and politics. The relationship between the church, the state and politics has been a subject of debate and controversy for centuries. The church as an institute upholds significant influence and power over the state and political decisions. In many societies. Religion plays a crucial role in shaping the political landscape and influencing policies. However, the separation of church and state is also found, is also a fundamental principle in many countries where the government is not supposed to be under control or influence of a particular religion. The discussion around this topic often revolves around issues such as the role of religion in government, the extent of religious freedoms, and the impact of religious beliefs on political decision making. Ultimately, the relationship between the church, state and politics is a complex and ongoing dialogue with various perspectives and viewpoints. So one of our questions for today is what are our thoughts on the separation of the church and how and state and how it impacts politics? And do you believe religion should play a role in government decisions? Well, this is quite a handful. Well, I'll take the lead on this. So one of the first four. The religion should not have a part to play in politics. I know some. I know you will often ask why? Well, that's because religion is a very powerful thing. Because one of the key things about religion is that bad things about religion is that religion doesn't, doesn't need to be explained. Anything can be in religion. Religion can believe that the earth was made from sand and green sand and everybody would take it that way. Because that's what we know. It doesn't have to make sense. All it's just needs to be. Just to be that. And it's that. So because of this, religion is so, is bland, is so, is, uh, what can I say? Uh, is just there. So I wanted about politics, is that politics, one thing gives to the other. Without this, you can't have that. So when you are wanting, when you want to include something on, is like an uncertainty with a certainty. If the canton cannot mix together, there will be problem. I mostly look at religion. Religion believes that the count they should. Each religion believes that there should only be one religion. So because of this, this are one of the reasons why religion cannot coexist, cannot play a role in government decision. One thing about religion, religion also supports it also is that believes that they can only be one religion. Christianity believes that it is the only, is the only original one. And every other thing is counterfeit, is fit and it's fake and we leave them to destruction. So because of this, if religions start playing a role in political, in government decisions, it will cause a bias. When a christian president is unseat, you will be biased towards Islam citizens, even though they are of the same nation, you understand it cause marginalization and they cause problem in society, in the government. So, so another, and there's another thing. Well, let's also look at nations who have been, let's take the Iran, Iraq, all these nations for example. They are being ruled by religion and is having negative effects on them. Number one, when number one is constitutional, what can I say? It's causes a tighter picture because everything around them is Islam, Islam, Islam. And because of that, christians are not what can I say, are not motivated to go there. And this affects their economy because even if personally, even if there are some artifacts there, some choice attractions there, I wouldn't go there because of their religion. That is a religious state. So this is, and this is affecting the economy. So these are one of the reasons why, what can I say? Why religion cannot play or should not play a role in government decisions. Let me cut you there. Let me cut you there. I don't, I certainly do not agree with what you are saying. I agree. I certainly do not agree with what you have said because honestly I believe religion should have a play, I honestly believe, don't believe that religion should have a plain. Religion should have a play in the state and all others. Because when you look at it without religion, what are we, we have to draw closer to God. Imagine if we have, we are in a tie down now. And we don't, just like the country is ruled by nothing. We are just, there is nothing between us. There is no religion. The country should have a united liturgy and Muslim. And this, okay, this time when look at it, sorry, like Christians will rule in till 1960 to maybe 2020, then 2020 muslims will rule. Imagine it now the Christians imagine if Muslims have been winning consistently, the Christians will feel, the Christians will feel biased that probably, probably they are being cheated. But it will just be normal luck. But when everything is arranged according to religion, no one will feel bad cheated. So I believe that religion should be added to government. You should play a role in government. Yes. Okay. Thank you contribution. Thank you precious for your contribution. Okay. And I'll see you next time. Thank you.",my name is i did by a moment and i consensit recording on this audience my name is and i consented to ok today's topic is the church state politics relationship between the church the state politics has been a subject of debate and controversy for centuries that institute of hold significant influence and power over the state political decisions in many societies religion plays a crucial role in shaping the political landscape and influencing policies however the suppression of church and state is also found is also a fundamental principle in many countries where the government is not supposed to be under control or in terms of a particular religion the discussion around this topic often revolves around issues such as the role of religion in government the extent of religious freedoms and impact of just believes god decision making ultimately did it seem to church states put it six is a contest and ongoing dialogue with various prospects and so one of our questions and today's what our thoughts of the suppression of the church and how our state it impacts politics and do you believe religion role in government decisions while this is quite a harmful i think they did on this so while the first for should not add a part to play policies i know so i know you why well that's because religion is a very powerful is a very powerful things about religions and religion doesn't doesn't need to be explained anything can be religion religion can believe that earth was made from sand and everybody would take it that way because i will be no it doesn't make sense only just needs to be just to be dot and is that so because of this religion is is blunt is just there so i wanted about politics is that one thing used to without this you can't add that one you know want to want to include something together they'll be problem look at religion religion believes that the colonial believes that there shouldn't be one religion so because because of this is why religion cannot quiz coexist cannot play in government decision what is about religion also supports also is that believe that the colony one religion christianity believes that the co is the only

a bias when a christian president is on seat it will be biased towards islam citizens even though they are of the same nation you also cause and because probably in the government so so unders who i've been to iran iraq all these years for example being ruled by religion and negative effects on them number one it's conscious everything around there islam islam and because of that christians are not calling motivated to go there economy because even if even if past and even if there are some artifacts of toys attractions that i wouldn't go because of their religion that is just it's so it's around this is a is affecting their hold on me so this i want to reasons why religion cannot play i should not play a role in government decisions let me let me say i certainly did not what you said because honestly i believe religion should have religious havin others because when you look at it without religion what are we have to draw close out to god in if we have we are in down now and we don't we just like the country is ruled by nothing we are just there's nothing between us there's no religion the country should have a united nation muslim and this okay this time when look at it sorry like christians will rule in till nineteen sixty to maybe twenty twenty muslim will rule imagine if not they christians imagine if muslim will ruin it consistently the christians will feel

this audio. my name is precious omotosho and i consent to the recording of this audio. okay, so today's topic is the church, state and politics. the relationship between the church, the state and politics has been a subject of debate and controversy for centuries. the church as an institute upholds significant influence and power over the state and political decisions. in many societies. religion plays a crucial role in shaping the political landscape and influencing policies. however, the separation of church and state is also found, is also a fundamental principle in many countries where the government is not supposed to be under control or influence of a particular religion. the discussion around this topic often revolves around issues such as the role of religion in government, the extent of religious freedoms, and the impact of religious beliefs on political decision making. ultimately, the relationship between the church, state and politics is a complex and ongoing dialogue with various perspectives and viewpoints. so one of our questions for today is what are our thoughts on the separation of the church and how and state and how it impacts politics? and do you believe religion should play a role in government decisions? well, this is quite a handful. well, i'll take the lead on this. so one of the first four. the religion should not have a part to play in politics. i know some. i know you will often ask why? well, that's because religion is a very powerful thing. because one of the key things about religion is that bad things about religion is that religion doesn't, doesn't need to be explained. anything can be in religion. religion can believe that the earth was made from sand and green sand and everybody would take it that way. because that's what we know. it doesn't have to make sense. all it's just needs to be. just to be that. and it's that. so because of this, religion is so, is bland, is so, is, what can i say? uh, is just there. so i wanted about politics, is that politics, one thing gives to the other. without this, you can't have that. so when you are wanting, when you want to include something on, is like an uncertainty with a certainty. if the canton cannot mix together, there will be problem. i mostly look at religion. religion believes that the count they should. each religion believes that there should only be one religion. so because of this, this are one of the reasons why religion cannot coexist, cannot play a role in government decision. one thing about religion, religion also supports it also is that believes that they can only be one religion. christianity believes that it is the only, is the only original one. and every other thing is counterfeit, is fit and it's fake and we leave them to destruction. so because of this, if religions start playing a role in political, in government decisions, it will cause a bias. when a christian president is unseat, you will be biased towards islam citizens, even though they are of the same nation, you understand it cause marginalization and they cause problem in society, in the government. so, so another, and there's another thing. well, let's also look at nations who have been, let's take the iran, iraq, all these nations for example. they are being ruled by religion and is having negative effects on them. number one, when number one is constitutional, what can i say? it's causes a tighter picture because everything around them is islam, islam, islam. and because of that, christians are not what can i say, are not motivated to go there. and this affects their economy because even if personally, even if there are some artifacts there, some choice attractions there, i wouldn't go there because of their religion. that is a religious state. so this is, and this is affecting the economy. so these are one of the reasons why, what can i say? why religion cannot play or should not play a role in government decisions. let me cut you there. let me cut you there. i don't, i certainly do not agree with what you are saying. i agree. i certainly do not agree with what you have said because honestly i believe religion should have a play, i honestly believe, don't believe that religion should have a plain. religion should have a play in the state and all others. because when you look at it without religion, what are we, we have to draw closer to god. imagine if we have, we are in a tie down now. and we don't, just like the country is ruled by nothing. we are just, there is nothing between us. there is no religion. the country should have a united liturgy and muslim. and this, okay, this time when look at it, sorry, like christians will rule in till 1960 to maybe 2020, then 2020 muslims will rule. imagine it now the christians imagine if muslims have been winning consistently, the christians will feel, the christians will feel biased that probably, probably they are being cheated. but it will just be normal luck. but when everything is arranged according to religion, no one will feel bad cheated. so i believe that religion should be added to government. you should play a role in government. yes. okay. thank you contribution. thank you precious for your contribution. okay. and i'll see you next time. thank you.",0.5053533190578159,my name is i did by a moment and i consensit recording on this audience my

I'm Sunday, and I consent to recording this conversation. Today we'll be talking on a very interesting topic. Sickle cell disease. What can you say about this disease? Okay. Sickle cell disease is actually a hematological disorder. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that when it is inherited, except the two forms, two abnormal genes are inherited. If not, the person will not manifest with the disorder. So it is an autosomal recessive disorder which affect the beta chain of the. Of the globe of hemoglobin, you understand? And then this beta chain, it's actually. At position six of the chain where there is replacement of glutamine by valine. And then it causes the blood, the blood cell to be sickle instead of a normal biconcave disc shape of the blood, you understand? And it makes it non deformable or it doesn't change shape easily when it is maneuvering or it's passing through blood vessels. So therefore, when it reaches capillaries, I mean, tiny vessels in the body, it becomes very. When there is deoxygenation, it becomes sickle shape. And this sickle shape prevents it from maneuvering this blood vessel, negotiating these blood vessels, and it sticks to the wall of the blood vessel and then occludes the blood vessel, forming tactoids. And over time, if this process. If this process continues, it's like a vicious cycle. Because of the deoxygenation, there is formation of this tactoid. And because of the formation of this tactoid, there's further deoxygenation, which causes increased formation of this tactoid. And there's an obstruction of blood vessel, and it manifests in various ways, you know, so which is usually called sickle cell crisis, the acute crisis of sickle cell, and then there are chronic crisis of sickle cell. So from what I understand, from what you are saying, you are trying to say that sickle cell is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, right? Yes, that is correct. That means the blood. What is the lifespan of a sickle cell blood and then a normal blood? Usually the lifespan of a normal blood is about 120 days, while that of sickle cell blood, blood cell is about 10 to 20 days. Some say 10 to 30 days. Okay, you mentioned something again. That sickle cell happens when a child receives two sickle cell genes. Yes. So why do. That's one from each parent? Yes. That's when two carriers AS and AS marry their self. They are likely to have a child with SS, the sickle cell hemoglobin. Yes. or let me explain it. For someone, usually for someone with AS and AS, you understand? A is the normal, while S is the abnormal, which is a sickle cell. So AS - AS, when they get married, there's a 25% chance that each of their child can come out as a sickler or as a sickle cell disease patient. I'm not saying that there's a 25% child that all their children chance that all their children or their children will be sickle cell patient. No, it's not as if when you give birth to one, two, three, the fourth one will be sickle cell patient. No, that is not the chance. The chances are each of the child. They give birth to has a 25% chance of being a sickler. So it is even possible that all your children will not be sickle cell patient. And it's possible that all your children can still be. It's possible that two of your children, maybe out of four, can be. So it's just like that. Okay, thank you. So what are the symptoms of this sickle cell? Okay, I was talking about sickle cell crisis earlier. So the acute crisis include things like vaso-occlusive crisis, hyperhemolytic crisis, sequestration crisis, and aplastic crisis. So what is vaso occlusive crisis? Now, like I explained earlier, there is occlusion of the blood vessel by formation of this tactoid, and then this causes vaso occlusion. This is what they call vaso occlusion, and it leads to a crisis and painful Can you please explain what occlusion means. Okay. Occlusion means obstruction in a blood vessel. Okay Yeah. You know, the blood vessel is usually patents, allowing flow of blood. So when there is an obstruction by formation of this sickle cell, or tactoids, as the case may be, then it is called vaso occlusive crisis. And it can occur anywhere in the body, you understand? It can occur in the brain, where it is called cerebral crisis, acute cerebral crisis. It can occur in the chest, which is called acute chest syndrome. It can occur in the abdomen, which is called mesenteric crisis. It can occur in the penis, which is called priapism. It can occur in the bone. They call it bone pain crisis. You understand? And this crisis comes with pain, severe pain, usually, which they usually are admitted for. And this crisis can be precipitated by various activities or conditions, like infection, like malaria, for instance, can precipitate the crisis. Stress, stressful condition, dehydration extremes of temperature, like maybe high temperature or low temperature. So each of these conditions can predispose them to developing this crisis, you understand? So the second crisis is aplastic crisis, where there is infection of immature blood cells in the bone marrow by parvovirus B 19. And then this, if this affect the development of the maturation of this blood in the bone marrow, to normal blood. Blood cells, you understand? Or to mature blood cells, let me put it that way. So they become anemic. And then you see that they do not get enough. When they say a plastic means it's coming from the bone marrow, there's affectation of the red blood cell line from the bone marrow. Then the next crisis, which is a sequestration crisis, is as a result of pooling of blood from the systemic circulation into the spleen, usually it presents with abdominal swelling and distension, you understand? Because the spleen, they present with splenomegally, the spleen becomes very distended. And then it pulls the blood and then it leads to anemia, severe anemia, and usually managed on admission with careful transmission of aliquot. Although we are going of blood, although we are going to talk about management of this condition, second, then fourthly, which is the last crisis in acute crisis is the hyperhemolytic crisis. Like the name implies, hyper hemolytic may increase destruction of blood cells. You know, these blood cells are actually not, they're actually not normal. So usually each time they flow through the, they flow through the spleen or it circulates through the spleen. They are usually tagged as abnormal blood because usually they have been affected in the systemic circulation when, where there is, anytime there is deoxygenation. So the spleen keeps destroying these blood cells. That's why you always see them presenting with jaundice, you understand? Because there's constant destruction of the breakdown of the red blood cell. So this leads to, this is what is called hyper hemolytic crisis. Okay, so in summary, you're saying that sickle cell patients may suffer from chronic anemia, fatigue, pain crisis, and then jaundice. Yes. These ones I just listed are the acute crisis. They are chronic crisis too. That's like. Are they like the complications of sickle cell. These are complications? Yes. And I think they include things like organ damage. Yeah. These are actually long term chronic crisis, Like Stroke Exactly. It can, sickle cell can manifest as stroke. What about infections? And then why do you think sickle cell patients, they usually have delayed growth like you see them, and then you see other normal children, they are all growing bigger. Then you see that the sickle cell child is left behind. Yes, This is called failure to thrive. Failure to thrive because usually they don't get enough oxygen. Their tissues don't get enough oxygen. So you don't expect the tissue that is not getting enough oxygen to grow well as normal as other cell, other people whose tissues are always getting enough oxygen. So they have this failure to thrive. Usually they're usually smaller than their pairs and the fact that they're always falling ill sick. So there are periods where they don't even get to eat well because they are sick for a very long period of time. So it affects them. You understand? So we are just saying something about stroke. Yes. Usually in adults, it's hemorrhagic stroke they do have. But in sickle cell patient, it is ischemic stroke. It's chemical in the sense that they don't get enough blood through the brain tissues, and then it leads to stroke. So let's talk about the chronic crisis. What about the infection? What kind of infection can they have? They can have any kind of infection. They can have malaria, they can have pneumonia, they can have even bone infections like osteomyelitis. Then finally, does the organ damage occur because there is no enough blood to this organ or is due to the infection? Like... It can come from both ways, you understand? Like I mentioned earlier, stroke is like a focal neurological deficit, a sudden onset of focal neurological deficit. That means the brain is being damaged. So when there is ischemic stroke, of course, blood is not really getting enough to the brain. So it can cause damage, you understand, of the blood of the brain. So the same thing with other organs, too. Enough oxygen is not reaching them, or, you understand, it can cause damage because there's like, kind of ischemia. There's not sometimes occlusion of the blood vessels. So what kind of medication do you think that sickle cell patients need? Like, actually, I know that they will have a lot Okay, before, before I get to that, I want to talk a little about the chronic crisis, which we have. The cardiomyopathies affecting the heart. We have retinopathies, the... sorry sickle cell retinopathies affecting the retina of the eyes. And then we also have sickle cells, sickle cell nephropathy affecting the nephrons, you understand? So these are some of the chronic crisis. Over time, there's accumulation, and then there's repeated ischemia to these tissues, and then it affects them. You get the point. So now talking about management of sickle cell patients, it's not a curable disease anyways. Although we've heard about stem cell transplants in developed countries, however, in a country like ours, usually is being managed. And management of this involves a lot of effort and involves a lot of understanding and cooperation between the patient, the caregiver of the patient, and also the hospital, the facility where the patient is actually being managed, you understand? So first of all, you give some medications which help them to prevent or reduce the number of crises they have. Like pain relievers. No, this in this case to prevent or to reduce the number of crises they have. I'm talking about medications like. Like malaria, chemoprophylaxis. This time around, it's usually fansidar they give, you understand? So they give them fansidar once a month. That helps them to reduce or to prevent malaria, you understand? It's a prophylaxis from malaria. Hydroxyurea is also given, which helps in increased production of fetal hemoglobin, which also have increased affinity for oxygen. It helps them reduce the crisis, the frequency of crisis as well. Then they are usually giving folic acid too, you understand? They are not giving iron because they have excess of iron from breakdown of red blood cells. So they are not usually giving iron. I also heard that they advise to take water frequently, avoid stressful exposure, and then, and then exposure to extremes of temperature, like extremes of heat and cold. So how is it being managed when they're in crisis? Okay, it's usually depending on the crisis they present with, you know? So for instance, for someone who presents with vessel occlusive crisis, you're usually in pain, then they are giving. Usually management involve pain management. Where they are giving painkillers, usually they are giving pentazosine. And also you want to rehydrate them because some. Most times they come with dehydration and you are being rehydrated with one and a half maintenance, you understand? That is one and a half maintenance for normal individual. And then you want to also check whether they have infection, because most times infection precipitates like malaria or pneumonia, as the case may be. You also manage with antibiotics or appropriate antibiotics or anti-malarial to treat the infection. You also want to give oxygen if there is need for that. The same way if they present with acute chest syndrome, you follow this management and then you also want to give oxygen. You also want to do chest physiotherapy for them. And sometimes it may require for you to do exchange blood transfusion if there is no improvement. In the same way, if they're present with sequestration crisis, you are going to transfer, you may have to transfuse them, but then you transfuse in aliquot. That is, you don't transfuse everything at once because it is risky. The spleen may just decide to release the blood into the circulation at once and it will lead to excess blood in circulation, which is in itself is also bad. I feel like instead of trying to find ways to manage this sickle cell, we should find ways to even prevent it from occurring at all. Like, how do you think apart from people advice to am people with the genotype AS and AS are advice not to marry each other. But some of them are not even aware of this. So I think there should be more awareness and more counseling. And then before marriage, people are supposed to go on screen and know their genotype. I hope you know your genotype. Yes, I know my genotype and I agree with the point you are trying to make. It's actually apart. So they are also. People are also to go for marriage counseling, you understand, especially by professionals in the society, like coming to hospital, as the case may be, or even if it's in churches that are well informed, they should go for marriage counseling so that they'll be counseled properly to avoid this condition, you understand? People also talked about permanent cure or treatment for this condition. Well, I heard in some countries, in some very advanced countries and facilities, they do stem cell transplants, your bone marrow transplant, and this helps to cure the condition. However, it is very expensive at the moment. Very few people can afford it. However, there are new researches going on. There are novel researches going on with the hope that they will come up with treatment modalities that can be affordable and that can lead to cure this condition. It is our hope that as time goes on, we will find a cure, a permanent cure for sickle cell anemia, And then this condition will not be a problem to the world. Living with sickle cell can be very challenging on both the sickler and then the families and the loved ones of the sickle. And then I feel like we should give them all the support they need and then we should try to avoid anything that has to do with stigmatization of the disease and the people living with the disease. They should be allowed to have jobs that they can handle, that their health condition can handle, and then they should be allowed to socialize, and then they should be allowed to also have relationship study, some kind of course, all kind of courses that they actually desire. There should be no stigmatization. The whole society should come together to support these people, because already they are already going through a whole lot. I agree with you on that. And then once again, you are all advised to know your genotype. If you haven't done that, try to do that today. And try to also let us all come together to totally eradicate sickle from our society, know your genotype. Speaker 2]: Know your genotype Speaker 1]: Know your genotype",my name is f e n i consensor record in this conversation i'm sunday and i consensor record in this conversation so there will be talking on a very interesting topic sickle cell disease what you say about disease disease actually disorder not also more recessive disorder meaning that when it's inherited except the two forms that two abnormal genes are inherited if not the person will not manifest with the disorder so it is anatosome recessive disorder which affect the betar chain of the of the globe of homoglobin you understand and then this betar chain it's actually a position six of the chain where there's replacement of glutamine by violin and then it causes the blood the blood cell to be secal instead of a normal by concave disc shape of the blood and it makes it non deformable or it doesn't change shape easily when it is maneuvering or it's passing through blood vessels so therefore when it's reaches capillaries i mean tiny vessels in the body it becomes very wendy's initial it's becomes sequential and the secret prevents it from maneuvering these blood vessel negotiating these blood vessels and it sticks to the wall of the blood vessel and then occludes the blood vessel forming tactoids and over time it's this process if this process continues like a vicious cycle because of the deals in nation there's formation of this tactoid and because of the formation of this tactoid there's for that deoxy nation which causes increase formation of this tactoid and there's a obstruction of blood vessel and it manifests in you know so which is usually called sequel cell crisis acute crisis of sequel cell and then the chronic crisis of sequel cell so for us i understand from what you're saying you're trying to say that sequel cell is a genetic disorder characterized by abdominal hemoglobin right yes that means the blood lifespan of a sickle cell blood and then the normal blood usually the lifespan of a normal blood is about one to twenty days why doubt of sique cell blood blood cell is about ten to twenty days some ten to thirty days okay you mention something again that sique cell happens child received two sequel cell genes yes so why do that's one from each parent yes that's going to carry us and it is married yourself and likely to have a child with s s it could be yes or let me explain it for someone usually for someone with you understand a is the normal you understand what s is the abnormality of the secret cell so a s a s when they get married there's a twenty five percent chance that each of their child can come out as a secular or as a sequel cell dispatch i'm not saying a twenty five percent child or that children chance that all that you know be secret no it's not when you bet one to three defaults of the secret selfish no that is not a chance the chance that each of the child you bet to have a twenty five percent chance of being a secular possible that all your children will not be sick of patient and then it's possible that all your children can still be it's possible that two of your children maybe out of four can be so it's it's just like that okay so what are the symptoms of the sickle cell okay i was talking about sickle cell crisis earlier so the acute crisis include things like vasal occlusive crisis hyperhemolitic crisis sequestration crisis and a plastic crisis so what is vasiloclusive crisis now like i explained earlier there's occlusion of the blood vessel by formation of this tactoid and then this causes vasal occlusion occlusion and leads to a crisis and clusion means obstruction in your blood vessel okay you know your blood vessel usually patents a line flow of blood so when there's an obstruction by formation of this sicko cell or tactoids as the case may be then it is called vessel occlusive crisis and it cowcoan in you in the body you understand it's cow coin the brain where it is called cerebral crisis acuce cerebral crisis it's cowcoin the chest which is called acute chest syndrome it's cow coin the abdomen which is called mesenteric crisis it's cow coin the penis which is called preapizing it's cow coined the bone they call it bone cry bone pain crisis you understand and these things this crises come with pain severe pain usually which they usually are admitted for and this crises can be precipitated by various activities or conditions like infection malaria for instance can precipitate crisis stress stressful condition dehydration extremes of temperature like maybe high temperature or low temperature so each of these conditions companies pose them to developing this crisis so the second crisis is a plastic crisis where there's infection of immature cells in the bone marrow by papovirus b nineteen and then this if this affect the developed building maturation of these bloods this blood in the bone marrow to normal blood blood cells you understand or to mature blood cells and put it so they become an then you see that they do not get innovative plastic means is coming from the boom there's affectation of the red blood cell lining from the boom then the next crisis which is the sequester crisis is as a result of pulling of blood from the systemic circulation into the spleen usually present with abdominal swelling distention you understand because the spleen became becomes the president was plain omega this plane become very distended and then it boost the blood and then it's to anemia severe anemia i usually manage on admission careful transmission of alico we're going of blood although we're going to talk about management of this this condition second then top forty which is the last crisis in acute crisis is the hyper hamolitic crisis one like the name implies hyper hamolitic mean increase destruction of blood cells you know these blood cells actually not actually not normal so usually each time they flow to the flow to the spleen or the circulates to the spleen they're usually targets abnormal blood because usually they have been affected in the systemic circulation when where there's the when any time there's the osce nation so the spleen keeps destroying these blood cells that's why you see them presenting with john d's you understand because there's constant destruction of the big no the so this needs to this is what is called hyper humanity crisis so in some way you're saying that sickle cell patients may suffer from chronic anemia and then yes i think this one i just listed the acute crisis they are chronic crisis like the complications of circumstances and i think it's like organ damage yeah these are actually long term chronic crisis like exactly manifest us to buy infections and then why do you think sequel patients usually have delayed groups like you see them and then you see other no mouth children all green big and then you see that the sequel so child behind yes this is called failure to drive failure to try because usually get enough oxygen that tissues don't get enough oxygen so you don't expect that tissue that is not getting of oxygen to grow well normal cell or people whose tissues are always getting enough oxygen so they have this failure to try usually usually smaller than their peers and the fact that they're always falling ill sick there are periods where they don't even get to eat well because they are sick for a very long period of time so it affects them you understand so you are just saying something about stroke usually in adults hemorrhagic stroke they do have but in chicago cell patients it is chemic stroke it's chemic in the sense that they don't get enough blood to the brain tissues and then it leads to stroke so let's talk about the chronic crisis what about the infection what kind of infection can they have they can have any kind of infection they can have malaria they can have pneumonia they can have even bone infections like osteomelitis then finally damage occur because there is no enough blow to this organ or is due to the infection like it can come from both ways you understand like i mentioned earlier stroke is like a carniol neurological deficit a sudden onset of fucar neurological deficit i mean the brain is being damaged so when there's a scheme stroke of course blood is not really getting enough to the brain so it can cause damage you understand of of the blood of the brain so the same thing with other organs too enough oxygen is not reaching them or you understand it can cause damage because there's like kind of it's chemia there's not sometimes of occlusion of the blood vessels so what kind of medica you think that patients need like i said i know that i want to talk a little about the crisis which we have the cardio myopa's affecting the heart we have new parties new parties affecting the and then also have secret cells in their secrets on a fruit party affecting the nephone you understand so this are some of the chronic crisis over time there's a condition and it is disceded it's kenya to just issues and then it affects them you get the point so now talking about management of secret cell patients disease anyways we've heard about stem cell transplants in developed countries however in a country like ours usually it's being managed and management of this involves a lot of effort and involves a lot of understanding and cooperation between the patient the caregiver of a patient and also the hospital the facility where the patient is actually being managed you understand so first of all you give some medications which help them to prevent or reduce the number of crises they have no this in this case to prevent or to reduce the number of crises they have i'm talking about medications like like malaria prophe chemo prophylaxis this time around it's usually fancy that they give you understand so they give them fancier once a month that helps them to reduce or to prevent malaria you understand it's a prophylaxis for malaria hydroxyria is also given which helps increase production of which also have increased affinity for reduce the crisis difficulty of crisis as well then they're usually giving acid to understand they're not giving iron because they have excess of iron from breakdown of fiblo cells so they're also had that the advice to take what i frequently voice stressful exposure and then and then as puzzles us streams of temperature like streams of heat and cold so high is it be money's rendering crisis depending on the crisis the present you know so for instance for someone who presents with vessel acclosive crisis they're usually in pain and then they are giving usually management involve pain management where they are giving painkillers usually they are giving paintaglesin and also you want to rehydrate them because something most times call me dehydration one and a half maintenance you understand that is one and half maintenance for normal individual and then you want to also check whether you have infection because most times infection precipitated like malaria or pneumonia as a case may be you also with antibiotics or appropriate antibiotics infection you also want to give oxygen if there is need for that the same way if the present with acute chest syndrome you follow this management and then you also want to give oxygen you also want to do chest physiotherapy for them and sometimes it may require you to do exchange blood transfusion if there is no improvement in some way the present with sequestration crisis you are going to transfer you may have to transfuse that but then you transfuse in ali court that is you don't transfuse everything at once because it is risky the spleen may just decide to release the blood into the who needs to access blood in circulation which is also bad i feel like instead of trying to find ways to manage the sequel still we should find ways to prevent it from occurring that like how do you think apart from people advice to people with a genocide and a s advice not to marry each other but some of them are not even aware of this so i think there should be more awareness and more counselling and then before marriage people are supposed to go and screen and know their genocide i hope you know your genocide yes i know my genocide and i agree with the point you're trying to make actually apt so they are also people also should go for marriage counselling you understand especially by professionals in our in the society like coming to hospital as a case may be or even if it's in churches that are well are well informed they should go for marriage counselling so that we counsel properly to avoid this condition people also talked about permanent cure or treatment for this condition well i heard in some countries in some very advanced countries our facilities they do stem cell transplants your bone marrow transplant and this helps to cure the condition however it is very expensive at the moment very few people can afford it however there are new there are new research is going on there research is going on with the hope that they will come up with treatment modalities that can be affordable and that can lead to cure of this condition it is our hope that as time goes on we will find a cure a permanent cure for sickle cell anemia and then this condition will not be a problem too living with sickle cell can be very challenging on both the secular and then the families and loved ones of the secular and then i feel like we should give them all the support they need and then we should try to avoid anything that has to do with stigmatization of the disease and the people living with they should be allowed to have jobs that they can handle that their health condition and then they should be allowed to socialize and then they should be allowed to also have relationship study some kind of course all kind of courses that they actually desire they should be no stigmatization the whole society should come together to support this because already going through and then once again all advice to know your genocide if you haven't done that try to do that and i saw that us to all come together to tell their case who safe from our society know your genotype,my name is f e n i consensor record in this conversation i'm sunday and i consensor record in this conversation so

all come together to tell their case who safe from our society know your genotype,"my name is efi, and i consent to recording this conversation. i'm sunday, and i consent to recording this conversation. today we'll be talking on a very interesting topic. sickle cell disease. what can you say about this disease? okay. sickle cell disease is actually a hematological disorder. it is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that when it is inherited, except the two forms, two abnormal genes are inherited. if not, the person will not manifest with the disorder. so it is an autosomal recessive disorder which affect the beta chain of the. of the globe of hemoglobin, you understand? and then this beta chain, it's actually. at position six of the chain where there is replacement of glutamine by valine. and then it causes the blood, the blood cell to be sickle instead of a normal biconcave disc shape of the blood, you understand? and it makes it non deformable or it doesn't change shape easily when it is maneuvering or it's passing through blood vessels. so therefore, when it reaches capillaries, i mean, tiny vessels in the body, it becomes very. when there is deoxygenation, it becomes sickle shape. and this sickle shape prevents it from maneuvering this blood vessel, negotiating these blood vessels, and it sticks to the wall of the blood vessel and then occludes the blood vessel, forming tactoids. and over time, if this process. if this process continues, it's like a vicious cycle. because of the deoxygenation, there is formation of this tactoid. and because of the formation of this tactoid, there's further deoxygenation, which causes increased formation of this tactoid. and there's an obstruction of blood vessel, and it manifests in various ways, you know, so which is usually called sickle cell crisis, the acute crisis of sickle cell, and then there are chronic crisis of sickle cell. so from what i understand, from what you are saying, you are trying to say that sickle cell is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, right? yes, that is correct. that means the blood. what is the lifespan of a sickle cell blood and then a normal blood? usually the lifespan of a normal blood is about 120 days, while that of sickle cell blood, blood cell is about 10 to 20 days. some say 10 to 30 days. okay, you mentioned something again. that sickle cell happens when a child receives two sickle cell genes. yes. so why do. that's one from each parent? yes. that's when two carriers as and as marry their self. they are likely to have a child with ss, the sickle cell hemoglobin. yes. or let me explain it. for someone, usually for someone with as and as, you understand? a is the normal, while s is the abnormal, which is a sickle cell. so as - as, when they get married, there's a 25% chance that each of their child can come out as a sickler or as a sickle cell disease patient. i'm not saying that there's a 25% child that all their children chance that all their children or their children will be sickle cell patient. no, it's not as if when you give birth to one, two, three, the fourth one will be sickle cell patient. no, that is not the chance. the chances are each of the child. they give birth to has a 25% chance of being a sickler. so it is even possible that all your children will not be sickle cell patient. and it's possible that all your children can still be. it's possible that two of your children, maybe out of four, can be. so it's just like that. okay, thank you. so what are the symptoms of this sickle cell? okay, i was talking about sickle cell crisis earlier. so the acute crisis include things like vaso-occlusive crisis, hyperhemolytic crisis, sequestration crisis, and aplastic crisis. so what is vaso occlusive crisis? now, like i explained earlier, there is occlusion of the blood vessel by formation of this tactoid, and then this causes vaso occlusion. this is what they call vaso occlusion, and it leads to a crisis and painful can you please explain what occlusion means. okay. occlusion means obstruction in a blood vessel. okay yeah. you know, the blood vessel is usually patents, allowing flow of blood. so when there is an obstruction by formation of this sickle cell, or tactoids, as the case may be, then it is called vaso occlusive crisis. and it can occur anywhere in the body, you understand? it can occur in the brain, where it is called cerebral crisis, acute cerebral crisis. it can occur in the chest, which is called acute chest syndrome. it can occur in the abdomen, which is called mesenteric crisis. it can occur in the penis, which is called priapism. it can occur in the bone. they call it bone pain crisis. you understand? and this crisis comes with pain, severe pain, usually, which they usually are admitted for. and this crisis can be precipitated by various activities or conditions, like infection, like malaria, for instance, can precipitate the crisis. stress, stressful condition, dehydration extremes of temperature, like maybe high temperature or low temperature. so each of these conditions can predispose them to developing this crisis, you understand? so the second crisis is aplastic crisis, where there is infection of immature blood cells in the bone marrow by parvovirus b 19. and then this, if this affect the development of the maturation of this blood in the bone marrow, to normal blood. blood cells, you understand? or to mature blood cells, let me put it that way. so they become anemic. and then you see that they do not get enough. when they say a plastic means it's coming from the bone marrow, there's affectation of the red blood cell line from the bone marrow. then the next crisis, which is a sequestration crisis, is as a result of pooling of blood from the systemic circulation into the spleen, usually it presents with abdominal swelling and distension, you understand? because the spleen, they present with splenomegally, the spleen becomes very distended. and then it pulls the blood and then it leads to anemia, severe anemia, and usually managed on admission with careful transmission of aliquot. although we are going of blood, although we are going to talk about management of this condition, second, then fourthly, which is the last crisis in acute crisis is the hyperhemolytic crisis. like the name implies, hyper hemolytic may increase destruction of blood cells. you know, these blood cells are actually not, they're actually not normal. so usually each time they flow through the, they flow through the spleen or it circulates through the spleen. they are usually tagged as abnormal blood because usually they have been affected in the systemic circulation when, where there is, anytime there is deoxygenation. so the spleen keeps destroying these blood cells. that's why you always see them presenting with jaundice, you understand? because there's constant destruction of the breakdown of the red blood cell. so this leads to, this is what is called hyper hemolytic crisis. okay, so in summary, you're saying that sickle cell patients may suffer from chronic anemia, fatigue, pain crisis, and then jaundice. yes. these ones i just listed are the acute crisis. they are chronic crisis too. that's like. are they like the complications of sickle cell. these are complications? yes. and i think they include things like organ damage. yeah. these are actually long term chronic crisis, like stroke exactly. it can, sickle cell can manifest as stroke. what about infections? and then why do you think sickle cell patients, they usually have delayed growth like you see them, and then you see other normal children, they are all growing bigger. then you see that the sickle cell child is left behind. yes, this is called failure to thrive. failure to thrive because usually they don't get enough oxygen. their tissues don't get enough oxygen. so you don't expect the tissue that is not getting enough oxygen to grow well as normal as other cell, other people whose tissues are always getting enough oxygen. so they have this failure to thrive. usually they're usually smaller than their pairs and the fact that they're always falling ill sick. so there are periods where they don't even get to eat well because they are sick for a very long period of time. so it affects them. you understand? so we are just saying something about stroke. yes. usually in adults, it's hemorrhagic stroke they do have. but in sickle cell patient, it is ischemic stroke. it's chemical in the sense that they don't get enough blood through the brain tissues, and then it leads to stroke. so let's talk about the chronic crisis. what about the infection? what kind of infection can they have? they can have any kind of infection. they can have malaria, they can have pneumonia, they can have even bone infections like osteomyelitis. then finally, does the organ damage occur because there is no enough blood to this organ or is due to the infection? like it can come from both ways, you understand? like i mentioned earlier, stroke is like a focal neurological deficit, a sudden onset of focal neurological deficit. that means the brain is being damaged. so when there is ischemic stroke, of course, blood is not really getting enough to the brain. so it can cause damage, you understand, of the blood of the brain. so the same thing with other organs, too. enough oxygen is not reaching them, or, you understand, it can cause damage because there's like, kind of ischemia. there's not sometimes occlusion of the blood vessels. so what kind of medication do you think that sickle cell patients need? like, actually, i know that they will have a lot okay, before, before i get to that, i want to talk a little about the chronic crisis, which we have. the cardiomyopathies affecting the heart. we have retinopathies, the sorry sickle cell retinopathies affecting the retina of the eyes. and then we also have sickle cells, sickle cell nephropathy affecting the nephrons, you understand? so these are some of the chronic crisis. over time, there's accumulation, and then there's repeated ischemia to these tissues, and then it affects them. you get the point. so now talking about management of sickle cell patients, it's not a curable disease anyways. although we've heard about stem cell transplants in developed countries, however, in a country like ours, usually is being managed. and management of this involves a lot of effort and involves a lot of understanding and cooperation between the patient, the caregiver of the patient, and also the hospital, the facility where the patient is actually being managed, you understand? so first of all, you give some medications which help them to prevent or reduce the number of crises they have. like pain relievers. no, this in this case to prevent or to reduce the number of crises they have. i'm talking about medications like. like malaria, chemoprophylaxis. this time around, it's usually fansidar they give, you understand? so they give them fansidar once a month. that helps them to reduce or to prevent malaria, you understand? it's a prophylaxis from malaria. hydroxyurea is also given, which helps in increased production of fetal hemoglobin, which also have increased affinity for oxygen. it helps them reduce the crisis, the frequency of crisis as well. then they are usually giving folic acid too, you understand? they are not giving iron because they have excess of iron from breakdown of red blood cells. so they are not usually giving iron. i also heard that they advise to take water frequently, avoid stressful exposure, and then, and then exposure to extremes of temperature, like extremes of heat and cold. so how is it being managed when they're in crisis? okay, it's usually depending on the crisis they present with, you know? so for instance, for someone who presents with vessel occlusive crisis, you're usually in pain, then they are giving. usually management involve pain management. where they are giving painkillers, usually they are giving pentazosine. and also you want to rehydrate them because some. most times they come with dehydration and you are being rehydrated with one and a half maintenance, you understand? that is one and a half maintenance for normal individual. and then you want to also check whether they have infection, because most times infection precipitates like malaria or pneumonia, as the case may be. you also manage with antibiotics or appropriate antibiotics or anti-malarial to treat the infection. you also want to give oxygen if there is need for that. the same way if they present with acute chest syndrome, you follow this management and then you also want to give oxygen. you also want to do chest physiotherapy for them. and sometimes it may require for you to do exchange blood transfusion if there is no improvement. in the same way, if they're present with sequestration crisis, you are going to transfer, you may have to transfuse them, but then you transfuse in aliquot. that is, you don't transfuse everything at once because it is risky. the spleen may just decide to release the blood into the circulation at once and it will lead to excess blood in circulation, which is in itself is also bad. i feel like instead of trying to find ways to manage this sickle cell, we should find ways to even prevent it from occurring at all. like, how do you think apart from people advice to am people with the genotype as and as are advice not to marry each other. but some of them are not even aware of this. so i think there should be more awareness and more counseling. and then before marriage, people are supposed to go on screen and know their genotype. i hope you know your genotype. yes, i know my genotype and i agree with the point you are trying to make. it's actually apart. so they are also. people are also to go for marriage counseling, you understand, especially by professionals in the society, like coming to hospital, as the case may be, or even if it's in churches that are well informed, they should go for marriage counseling so that they'll be counseled properly to avoid this condition, you understand? people also talked about permanent cure or treatment for this condition. well, i heard in some countries, in some very advanced countries and facilities, they do stem cell transplants, your bone marrow transplant, and this helps to cure the condition. however, it is very expensive at the moment. very few people can afford it. however, there are new researches going on. there are novel researches going on with the hope that they will come up with treatment modalities that can be affordable and that can lead to cure this condition. it is our hope that as time goes on, we will find a cure, a permanent cure for sickle cell anemia, and then this condition will not be a problem to the world. living with sickle cell can be very challenging on both the sickler and then the families and the loved ones of the sickle. and then i feel like we should give them all the support they need and then we should try to avoid anything that has to do with stigmatization of the disease and the people living with the disease. they should be allowed to have jobs that they can handle, that their health condition can handle, and then they should be allowed to socialize, and then they should be allowed to also have relationship study, some kind of course, all kind of courses that they actually desire. there should be no stigmatization. the whole society should come together to support these people, because already they are already going through a whole lot. i agree with you on that. and then once again, you are all advised to know your genotype. if you haven't done that, try to do that today. and try to also let us all come together to totally eradicate sickle from our society, know your genotype. speaker 2]: know your genotype speaker 1]: know your genotype",0.3774276291681935,my name is f e n i consensor record in this conversation i am sunday and i consensor record in this conversation so there will be talking on a very interesting topic sickle cell disease what you say about disease disease actually disorder not also more recessive disorder meaning that when it is inherited except the 2 forms that 2 abnormal genes are inherited if not the person will not manifest with the disorder so it is anatosome recessive disorder which affect the betar chain of the of the globe of homoglobin you understand and then this betar chain it is actually a position 6 of the chain where there is replacement of glutamine by violin and then it causes the blood the blood cell to be secal instead of a normal by concave disk shape of the blood and it makes it non deformable or it does not change shape easily when it is maneuvering or it is passing through blood vessels so therefore when it is reaches capillaries i mean tiny vessels in the body it becomes very wendy is initial it is becomes sequential and the secret prevents it from maneuvering these blood vessel negotiating these blood vessels and it sticks to the wall of the blood vessel and then occludes the blood vessel forming tactoids and over time it is this process if this process continues like a vicious cycle because of the deals in nation there is formation of this tactoid and because of the formation of this tactoid there is for that deoxy nation which causes increase formation of this tactoid and there is a obstruction of blood vessel and it manifests in you know so which is usually called sequel cell crisis acute crisis of sequel cell and then the chronic crisis of sequel cell so for us i understand from what you are saying you are trying to say that sequel cell is a genetic disorder characterized by abdominal hemoglobin right yes that means the blood lifespan of a sickle cell blood and then the normal blood usually the lifespan of a normal blood is about one to 20 days why doubt of sique cell blood blood cell is about 10 to 20 days some 10 to 30 days okay you mention something again that sique cell happens child received 2 sequel cell genes yes so why do that is one from each parent yes that is going to carry us and it is married yourself and likely to have a child with s s it could be yes or let me explain it for someone usually for someone with you understand a is the normal you understand what s is the abnormality of the secret cell so a s a s when they get married there is a 25% chance that each of their child can come out as a secular or as a sequel cell dispatch i am not saying a 25% child or that children chance that all that you know be secret no it is not when you bet one to 3 defaults of the secret selfish no that is not a chance the chance that each of the child you bet to have a 25% chance of being a secular possible that all your children will not be sick of patient and then it is possible that all your children can still be it is possible that 2 of your children maybe out of 4 can be so it is it is just like that okay so what are the symptoms of the sickle cell okay i was talking about sickle cell crisis earlier so the acute crisis include things like vasal occlusive crisis hyperhemolitic crisis sequestration crisis and a plastic crisis so what is vasiloclusive crisis now like i explained earlier there is occlusion of the blood vessel by formation of this tactoid and then this causes vasal occlusion occlusion and leads to a crisis and clusion means obstruction in your blood vessel okay you know your blood vessel usually patents a line flow of blood so when there is an obstruction by formation of this sicko cell or tactoids as the case may be then it is called vessel occlusive crisis and it cowcoan in you in the body you understand it is cow coin the brain where it is called cerebral crisis acuce cerebral crisis it is cowcoin the chest which is called acute chest syndrome it is cow coin the abdomen which is called mesenteric crisis it is cow coin the penis which is called preapizing it is cow coined the bone they call it bone cry bone pain crisis you understand and these things this crises come with pain severe pain usually which they usually are admitted for and this crises can be precipitated by various activities or conditions like infection malaria for instance can precipitate crisis stress stressful condition dehydration extremes of temperature like maybe high temperature or low temperature so each of these conditions companies pose them to developing this crisis so the 2nd crisis is a plastic crisis where there is infection of immature cells in the bone marrow by papovirus b 19 and then this if this affect the developed building maturation of these bloods this blood in the bone marrow to normal blood blood cells you understand or to mature blood cells and put it so they become an then you see that they do not get innovative plastic means is coming from the boom there is affectation of the red blood cell lining from the boom then the next crisis which is the sequester crisis is as a result of pulling of blood from the systemic circulation into the spleen usually present with abdominal swelling distention you understand because the spleen became becomes the president was plain omega this plane become very distended and then it boost the blood and then it is to anemia severe anemia i usually manage on admission careful transmission of alico we are going of blood although we are going to talk about management of this this condition 2nd then top 40 which is the last crisis in acute crisis is the hyper hamolitic crisis one like the name implies hyper hamolitic mean increase destruction of blood cells you know these blood cells actually not actually not normal so usually each time they flow to the flow to the spleen or the circulates to the spleen they are usually targets abnormal blood because usually they have been affected in the systemic circulation when where there is the when any time there is the osce nation so the spleen keeps destroying these blood cells that is why you see them presenting with john d is you understand because there is constant destruction of the big no the so this needs to this is what is called hyper humanity crisis so in some way you are saying that sickle cell patients may suffer from chronic anemia and then yes i think this one i just listed the acute crisis they are chronic crisis like the complications of circumstances and i think it is like organ damage yeah these are actually long term chronic crisis like exactly manifest us to buy infections and then why do you think sequel patients usually have delayed groups like you see them and then you see other no mouth children all green big and then you see that the sequel so child behind yes this is called failure to drive failure to try because usually get enough oxygen that tissues do not get enough oxygen so you do not expect that tissue that is not getting of oxygen to grow well normal cell or people whose tissues are always getting enough oxygen so they have this failure to try usually usually smaller than their peers and the fact that they are always falling ill sick there are periods where they do not even get to eat well because they are sick for a very long period of time so it affects them you understand so you are just saying something about stroke usually in adults hemorrhagic stroke they do have but in chicago cell patients it is chemic stroke it is chemic in the sense that they do not get enough blood to the brain tissues and then it leads to stroke so let us talk about the chronic crisis what about the infection what kind of infection can they have they can have any kind of infection they can have malaria they can have pneumonia they can have even bone infections like osteomelitis then finally damage occur because there is no enough blow to this organ or is due to the infection like it can come from both ways you understand like i mentioned earlier stroke is like a carniol neurological deficit a sudden onset of fucar neurological deficit i mean the brain is being damaged so when there is a scheme stroke of course blood is not really getting enough to the brain so it can cause damage you understand of of the blood of the brain so the same thing with other organs too enough oxygen is not reaching them or you understand it can cause damage because there is like kind of it is chemia there is not sometimes of occlusion of the blood vessels so what kind of medica you think that patients need like i said i know that i want to talk a little about the crisis which we have the cardio myopa is affecting the heart we have new parties new parties affecting the and then also have secret cells in their secrets on a fruit party affecting the nephone you understand so this are some of the chronic crisis over time there is a condition and it is disceded it is kenya to just issues and then it affects them you get the point so now talking about management of secret cell patients disease anyways we have heard about stem cell transplants in developed countries however in a country like ours usually it is being managed and management of this involves a lot of effort and involves a lot of understanding and cooperation between the patient the caregiver of a patient and also the hospital the facility where the patient is actually being managed you understand so 1st of all you give some medications which help them to prevent or reduce the number of crises they have no this in this case to prevent or to reduce the number of crises they have i am talking about medications like like malaria prophe chemo prophylaxis this time around it is usually fancy that they give you understand so they give them fancier once a month that helps them to reduce or to prevent malaria you understand it is a prophylaxis for malaria hydroxyria is also given which helps increase production of which also have increased affinity for reduce the crisis difficulty of crisis as well then they are usually giving acid to understand they are not giving iron because they have excess of iron from breakdown of fiblo cells so they are also had that the advice to take what i frequently voice stressful exposure and then and then as puzzles us streams of temperature like streams of heat and cold so high is it be money is rendering crisis depending on the crisis the present you know so for instance for someone who presents with vessel acclosive crisis they are usually in pain and then they are giving usually management involve pain management where they are giving painkillers usually they are giving paintaglesin and also you want to rehydrate them because something most times call me dehydration one.5 maintenance you understand that is one and half maintenance for normal individual and then you want to also check whether you have infection because most times infection precipitated like malaria or pneumonia as a case may be you also with antibiotics or appropriate antibiotics infection you also want to give oxygen if there is need for that the same way if the present with acute chest syndrome you follow this management and then you also want to give oxygen you also want to do chest physiotherapy for them and sometimes it may require you to do exchange blood transfusion if there is no improvement in some way the present with sequestration crisis you are going to transfer you may have to transfuse that but then you transfuse in ali court that is you do not transfuse everything at once because it is risky the spleen may just decide to release the blood into the who needs to access blood in circulation which is also bad i feel like instead of trying to find ways to manage the sequel still we should find ways to prevent it from occurring that like how do you think apart from people advice to people with a genocide and a s advice not to marry each other but some of them are not even aware of this so i think there should be more awareness and more counseling and then before marriage people are supposed to go and screen and know their genocide i hope you know your genocide yes i know my genocide and i agree with the point you are trying to make actually apt so they are also people also should go for marriage counseling you understand especially by professionals in our in the society like coming to hospital as a case may be or even if it is in churches that are well are well informed they should go for marriage counseling so that we counsel properly to avoid this condition people also talked about permanent cure or treatment for this condition well i heard in some countries in some very advanced countries our facilities they do stem cell transplants your bone marrow transplant and this helps to cure the condition however it is very expensive at the moment very few people can afford it however there are new there are new research is going on there research is going on with the hope that they will come up with treatment modalities that can be affordable and that can lead to cure of this condition it is our hope that as time goes on we will find a cure a permanent cure for sickle cell anemia and then this condition will not be a problem too living with sickle cell can be very challenging on both the secular and then the families and loved ones of the secular and then i feel like we should give them all the support they need and then we should try to avoid anything that has to do with stigmatization of the disease and the people living with they should be allowed to have jobs that they can handle that their health condition and then they should be allowed to socialize and then they should be allowed to also have relationship study some kind of course all kind of courses that they actually desire they should be no stigmatization the whole society should come together to support this because already going through and then once again all advice to know your genocide if you have not done that try to do that and i saw that us to all come together to tell their case who safe from our society know your genotype,my name is efi and i consent to recording this conversation i am sunday and i consent to recording this conversation today we will be talking on a very interesting topic sickle cell disease what can you say about this disease okay sickle cell disease is actually a hematological disorder it is an autosomal recessive disorder meaning that when it is inherited except the 2 forms 2 abnormal genes are inherited if not the person will not manifest with the disorder so it is an autosomal recessive disorder which affect the beta chain of the of the globe of hemoglobin you understand and then this beta chain it is actually at position 6 of the chain where there is replacement of glutamine by valine and then it causes the blood the blood cell to be sickle instead of a normal biconcave disk shape of the blood you understand and it makes it non deformable or it does not change shape easily when it is maneuvering or it is passing through blood vessels so therefore when it reaches capillaries i mean tiny vessels in the body it becomes very when there is deoxygenation it becomes sickle shape and this sickle shape prevents it from maneuvering this blood vessel negotiating these blood vessels and it sticks to the wall of the blood vessel and then occludes the blood vessel forming tactoids and over time if this process if this process continues it is like a vicious cycle because of the deoxygenation there is formation of this tactoid and because of the formation of this tactoid there is further deoxygenation which causes increased formation of this tactoid and there is an obstruction of blood vessel and it manifests in various ways you know so which is usually called sickle cell crisis the acute crisis of sickle cell and then there are chronic crisis of sickle cell so from what i understand from what you are saying you are trying to say that sickle cell is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin right yes that is correct that means the blood what is the lifespan of a sickle cell blood and then a normal blood usually the lifespan of a normal blood is about 120 days while that of sickle cell blood blood cell is about 10 to 20 days some say 10 to 30 days okay you mentioned something again that sickle cell happens when a child receives 2 sickle cell genes yes so why do that is one from each parent yes that is when 2 carriers as and as marry their self they are likely to have a child with ss the sickle cell hemoglobin yes or let me explain it for someone usually for someone with as and as you understand a is the normal while s is the abnormal which is a sickle cell so as as when they get married there is a 25% chance that each of their child can come out as a sickler or as a sickle cell disease patient i am not saying that there is a 25% child that all their children chance that all their children or their children will be sickle cell patient no it is not as if when you give birth to 123 the 4th one will be sickle cell patient no that is not the chance the chances are each of the child they give birth to has a 25% chance of being a sickler so it is even possible that all your children will not be sickle cell patient and it is possible that all your children can still be it is possible that 2 of your children maybe out of 4 can be so it is just like that okay thank you so what are the symptoms of this sickle cell okay i was talking about sickle cell crisis earlier so the acute crisis include things like vaso occlusive crisis hyperhemolytic crisis sequestration crisis and aplastic crisis so what is vaso occlusive crisis now like i explained earlier there is occlusion of the blood vessel by formation of this tactoid and then this causes vaso occlusion this is what they call vaso occlusion and it leads to a crisis and painful can you please explain what occlusion means okay occlusion means obstruction in a blood vessel okay yeah you know the blood vessel is usually patents allowing flow of blood so when there is an obstruction by formation of this sickle cell or tactoids as the case may be then it is called vaso occlusive crisis and it can occur anywhere in the body you understand it can occur in the brain where it is called cerebral crisis acute cerebral crisis it can occur in the chest which is called acute chest syndrome it can occur in the abdomen which is called mesenteric crisis it can occur in the penis which is called priapism it can occur in the bone they call it bone pain crisis you understand and this crisis comes with pain severe pain usually which they usually are admitted for and this crisis can be precipitated by various activities or conditions like infection like malaria for instance can precipitate the crisis stress stressful condition dehydration extremes of temperature like maybe high temperature or low temperature so each of these conditions can predispose them to developing this crisis you understand so the 2nd crisis is aplastic crisis where there is infection of immature blood cells in the bone marrow by parvovirus b 19 and then this if this affect the development of the maturation of this blood in the bone marrow to normal blood blood cells you understand or to mature blood cells let me put it that way so they become anemic and then you see that they do not get enough when they say a plastic means it is coming from the bone marrow there is affectation of the red blood cell line from the bone marrow then the next crisis which is a sequestration crisis is as a result of pooling of blood from the systemic circulation into the spleen usually it presents with abdominal swelling and distension you understand because the spleen they present with splenomegally the spleen becomes very distended and then it pulls the blood and then it leads to anemia severe anemia and usually managed on admission with careful transmission of aliquot although we are going of blood although we are going to talk about management of this condition 2nd then fourthly which is the last crisis in acute crisis is the hyperhemolytic crisis like the name implies hyper hemolytic may increase destruction of blood cells you know these blood cells are actually not they are actually not normal so usually each time they flow through the they flow through the spleen or it circulates through the spleen they are usually tagged as abnormal blood because usually they have been affected in the systemic circulation when where there is anytime there is deoxygenation so the spleen keeps destroying these blood cells that is why you always see them presenting with jaundice you understand because there is constant destruction of the breakdown of the red blood cell so this leads to this is what is called hyper hemolytic crisis okay so in summary you are saying that sickle cell patients may suffer from chronic anemia fatigue pain crisis and then jaundice yes these ones i just listed are the acute crisis they are chronic crisis too that is like are they like the complications of sickle cell these are complications yes and i think they include things like organ damage yeah these are actually long term chronic crisis like stroke exactly it can sickle cell can manifest as stroke what about infections and then why do you think sickle cell patients they usually have delayed growth like you see them and then you see other normal children they are all growing bigger then you see that the sickle cell child is left behind yes this is called failure to thrive failure to thrive because usually they do not get enough oxygen their tissues do not get enough oxygen so you do not expect the tissue that is not getting enough oxygen to grow well as normal as other cell other people whose tissues are always getting enough oxygen so they have this failure to thrive usually they are usually smaller than their pairs and the fact that they are always falling ill sick so there are periods where they do not even get to eat well because they are sick for a very long period of time so it affects them you understand so we are just saying something about stroke yes usually in adults it is hemorrhagic stroke they do have but in sickle cell patient it is ischemic stroke it is chemical in the sense that they do not get enough blood through the brain tissues and then it leads to stroke so let us talk about the chronic crisis what about the infection what kind of infection can they have they can have any kind of infection they can have malaria they can have pneumonia they can have even bone infections like osteomyelitis then finally does the organ damage occur because there is no enough blood to this organ or is due to the infection like it can come from both ways you understand like i mentioned earlier stroke is like a focal neurological deficit a sudden onset of focal neurological deficit that means the brain is being damaged so when there is ischemic stroke of course blood is not really getting enough to the brain so it can cause damage you understand of the blood of the brain so the same thing with other organs too enough oxygen is not reaching them or you understand it can cause damage because there is like kind of ischemia there is not sometimes occlusion of the blood vessels so what kind of medication do you think that sickle cell patients need like actually i know that they will have a lot okay before before i get to that i want to talk a little about the chronic crisis which we have the cardiomyopathies affecting the heart we have retinopathies the sorry sickle cell retinopathies affecting the retina of the eyes and then we also have sickle cells sickle cell nephropathy affecting the nephrons you understand so these are some of the chronic crisis over time there is accumulation and then there is repeated ischemia to these tissues and then it affects them you get the point so now talking about management of sickle cell patients it is not a curable disease anyways although we have heard about stem cell transplants in developed countries however in a country like ours usually is being managed and management of this involves a lot of effort and involves a lot of understanding and cooperation between the patient the caregiver of the patient and also the hospital the facility where the patient is actually being managed you understand so 1st of all you give some medications which help them to prevent or reduce the number of crises they have like pain relievers no this in this case to prevent or to reduce the number of crises they have i am talking about medications like like malaria chemoprophylaxis this time around it is usually fansidar they give you understand so they give them fansidar once a month that helps them to reduce or to prevent malaria you understand it is a prophylaxis from malaria hydroxyurea is also given which helps in increased production of fetal hemoglobin which also have increased affinity for oxygen it helps them reduce the crisis the frequency of crisis as well then they are usually giving folic acid too you understand they are not giving iron because they have excess of iron from breakdown of red blood cells so they are not usually giving iron i also heard that they advise to take water frequently avoid stressful exposure and then and then exposure to extremes of temperature like extremes of heat and cold so how is it being managed when they are in crisis okay it is usually depending on the crisis they present with you know so for instance for someone who presents with vessel occlusive crisis you are usually in pain then they are giving usually management involve pain management where they are giving painkillers usually they are giving pentazosine and also you want to rehydrate them because some most times they come with dehydration and you are being rehydrated with one.5 maintenance you understand that is one.5 maintenance for normal individual and then you want to also check whether they have infection because most times infection precipitates like malaria or pneumonia as the case may be you also manage with antibiotics or appropriate antibiotics or anti malarial to treat the infection you also want to give oxygen if there is need for that the same way if they present with acute chest syndrome you follow this management and then you also want to give oxygen you also want to do chest physiotherapy for them and sometimes it may require for you to do exchange blood transfusion if there is no improvement in the same way if they are present with sequestration crisis you are going to transfer you may have to transfuse them but then you transfuse in aliquot that is you do not transfuse everything at once because it is risky the spleen may just decide to release the blood into the circulation at once and it will lead to excess blood in circulation which is in itself is also bad i feel like instead of trying to find ways to manage this sickle cell we should find ways to even prevent it from occurring at all like how do you think apart from people advice to am people with the genotype as and as are advice not to marry each other but some of them are not even aware of this so i think there should be more awareness and more counseling and then before marriage people are supposed to go on screen and know their genotype i hope you know your genotype yes i

people because already they are already going through a whole lot i agree with you on that and then once again you are all advised to know your genotype if you have not done that try to do that today

And my name is Fredriu Kashim Salihu, and I consent to the recording of this audio. So, Fajilo, nice having you once again. Well, today we're going to be talking about which is more important, creativity or knowledge. So, you know, what is different when you think about creativity and knowledge? What strikes the difference between the two? I think creativity, in modern society, creativity is more independence than knowledge, because knowledge, someday, like knowledge, it comes, like through. When you get knowledge. Some people, when attaining knowledge, they go through government works and all those stuff. But creativity can be more independent. All right, so creativity is more. Knowledge is more restricted. You gain knowledge from someone else. Creativity is inbound, inborn, right. It's something that just comes from within, correct? Yes. Okay. So the debate over whether creativity or knowledge is more important has been a long standing topic of discussion among philosophers, scholars, and innovators. Both creativity and knowledge are essential elements in our lives. You agree with me on that, but there is no consensus on which one should be given more weights. Well, if you are to ask me, I would say both are very important. You need knowledge. You, you. It's good to be creativity. You need. You actually need knowledge to apply the creative aspect that you have. Exactly. You need that knowledge. But if you have only knowledge, without creativity, you are just like any other person. There's nothing special about you. You need to be creative for your knowledge to stand out. So, on one hand, knowledge is often perceived as the foundation of progress and advancement, while on the other hand, creativity is viewed as the driving force between innovation and originalism. In this ongoing debate, some believe that knowledge enables individuals to think critically and solve problems efficiently, while others argue that creativity allows for the exploration of new ideas and solutions. Ultimately, the importance of creativity and knowledge may depend on individual perspectives and context. So now for the. I want to ask you a question. What do you think is the key to success? Is it being creative or having vast knowledge on a topic. both are more important, but I think it leans more towards creativity in the current society that we are being creative, because knowledge. Knowledge is some. The knowledge is the key to success, but when that knowledge isn't able to be applied practically, won't really have any effect in society. Okay, so you. Creativity has a higher standing in the. If you have to put it in the balance, creativity will be weighing higher, right? Yes. Okay, I agree with you on that. So what has been your personal experience in balancing creativity and knowledge in your work or personal life. Like creative creativity. I'm still a second, I'm still a university student, but when it comes to creativity, I'm more focused on artwork and stuff like that. All right, so how you are more focused on artwork. Right. But you talked about you being a secondary school student, right or university student right. Okay, so you do know that there's a way to apply creativity into your studies. Yes, there is. You know? Right. So what comes, what kind of methods have you thought about and have you tried applying them? I personally, I haven't applied any creative aspect to my, my university life, but I think when applying creativity to your university life, stuff like engineering. When it comes to engineering, there are some stuff you can do outside of academic work that can help you earn money and stuff like that. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Being a bit fake, but I think I understand what you're trying to say. For me, when I think about creativity in studies, I'm thinking about, oh, how you and I are reading for both reason. Reading for 12 hours, right. In a day. Let's just assume that I read every 12 hours in a day. You also read 12 hours in a day. You read a whole 12 hours in a stretch. Maybe you only take breaks to eat or have a short nap or something like that, but then I read for the same 12 hours. But then maybe every 30 minutes I take a break, I just draw something, I scribble something down, or I just write a design or look up a dag, a cursive handwriting, a new course of handwriting and put it down. You know, just things that fancy my fancy, fancy my liking. For me, it's art. For somebody else, it might be music. So you might just take that break and use to bring your brain back to recover your brain, you know, drag your brain. Because the truth is that when you study, your brain tends to wear like your brain is being strained. So you have to bring jack your brain by bringing, rejuvenating it with things that it actually likes. So somebody who's creative will put those things in between reading times, while someone else who is like you, who is reading for that 12 hours will only stop when he needs to. Like maybe he needs, he's feeling sleepy, then he goes to take a nap, which is good. It's actually a great, it's a great plan. And also maybe he needs to, he's hungry, he goes to take a simple meal and come back. But I feel like the one who's taking breaks and being creative about it is going to have grasp more because the brain is looking forward to those breaks. I don't know if you get what I'm saying, but basically, I think that's how you apply creativity to studies. There are many other ways you can apply creativity to studies. Tooth tip of the iceberg. But also if you think about many other aspects in life. Let's talk about football. Because I know you love football. You can have all the knowledge about football that you want to, but if you don't have the skills, you won't prosper. Right? And even if you have the skills and you are playing football, if you're not creative about it, you won't stand out. What do you think makes Ronaldo and Messi stand up? They are creative about how they play. That's what makes them stand out in their. In their field. So I feel like creativity is just a topping that makes you stand out in whatever field you are in. If you're an engineering student, you stand out. If you're a pharmacy student, you stand out. Is there anything you want to add about this topic before we round off? I think that's all. Okay. You don't have anything else to add? Okay. Thank you very much, Fidel, for being here today. Thank you for having me.",hi my name is lima kashim salih who and i consent to the recording of this odd usim salih and i consent to do recording of this o u so fred nice having you um once again well today we're talking about um which is more important creativity or knowledge so you know what is different what's creativity and knowledge what strikes the difference between creativity in modern sight creativity's more independence than knowledge because knowledge some be like knowledge it comes like to when you get knowledge knowledge works and all creativity can be more independent alright so creativity is more restrict knowledge is more restricted you you gain knowledge from someone else creativity is inbound inbound right something that just comes from within correct okay so um the debate over whether creativity or knowledge is more important has been a long standing topic of discussion among philosophers scholars and innovators both creativity and knowledge are essential elements in our lives you agree with me on that both there is no consensus on which one should be given more weeks well if you have to ask me i'll say both are very important you need knowledge you you it's good to be creativity you need actually need knowledge to apply the creative aspect aspect that you have exactly you need their knowledge but if you have only knowledge creativity you are just like any other person there's nothing special about you you need to be creative for your knowledge to stand out so one hand knowledge is often perceived as the foundation of progress and advancement while on the other hand creativity is viewed as the driving force between innovation and originally saying in this ongoing debate some believe that knowledge enables individuals to think critically and solve problems efficiently while others argue that creativity allows for the exploration of new ideas and solution ultimately the importance of creativity and knowledge may depend on individual perspectives and context so now for you i want to ask you a question what do you think is the key to success is it being creative or having vast knowledge on a topic are more important but i think it leans more towards creativity in the current society that we are it leans towards being creative because knowledge knowledge is in society okay so you creativity has a higher standing in the if you are to put it in the balance creativity will be weighing higher right okay i agree i agree with you on that so what has been your personal experience in balancing creativity and knowledge in your work or personal life mm like creative creativity i'm still um a second uh i'm still a university student but when it comes to creativity i'm more focused on alright so um how you are more focused on arts work right but you talked about you being a secondary school student right a university student right okay so you you do know that there's a way to apply creativity into into your studies there is you know right so what comes what kind of methods have you thought about and have you tried applying them i personally i haven't applied any creative aspect to my university life but i think when applying for duty to university life stuff like engineering when it comes to engineering there are some stuff you can do outside of academic work that can help you earn money and stuff like that but i think i understand what you're trying to say for me when i think about creativity in storage i'm thinking about oh how you and i are within for bio books within reading for twelve hours right nyday let's just assume that i read every twelve hours nyday you also read twelve hours nyday you read a whole twelve hours in a stretch maybe breaks to eat or have it shorten up or something like that but then i read for the same twelve us but then maybe every thirty minutes i take a break i just draw something i scribble something down or i just write a design or look up a di um a course of hundred new courses hundred pretty down you know those things are fancy my fan fancy my liking for me it's art for somebody else it might be music so you might just take that brains to bring your brain back to recall rug your brain you know drag your brain because the show is that when you story your brain tends to wear like your brain is being strained so you have to bring jug your brain by bringing it which things that it actually likes so someone who's creative will put those things in between waiting times while someone else who is like hu who is waiting for just twelve hours only stop when he needs to like maybe he needs he's feeling sleepy then he goes to take a nap which is good it's actually greats it's a great plan and also maybe he needs to he's hungry he goes to take a simple meal and come back but i feel like the one who's taking breaks and being creative about it is going to have grasp more cause the brain is looking forward to those breaks i don't know if he gets what i'm saying but basically i think that's how you apply to store this there are many other ways you can ac apply creativity to store this is just a too tip of the iceberg but also if you think about many other aspects in life let's talk about football cause i know you love football you can't have all the knowledge about football that you want to but if you don't have the skills you won't prosper right and even if you have the skills and you are you are playing football if you're not creative about it you won't stand out what do you think makes runaldo and masses stand out they are creative about how they play that's what make them stand out in their in their field so i feel like creativity is is just a topic that makes you stand out in whatever field you are in if you're an engineering student you stand out if you're a pharmacist student you stand out is there anything else add about this topic don't have anything else to add okay thank you very much for you for being

and i consent to the recording of this audio. and my name is fredriu kashim salihu, and i consent to the recording of this audio. so, fajilo, nice having you once again. well, today we're going to be talking about which is more important, creativity or knowledge. so, you know, what is different when you think about creativity and knowledge? what strikes the difference between the two? i think creativity, in modern society, creativity is more independence than knowledge, because knowledge, someday, like knowledge, it comes, like through. when you get knowledge. some people, when attaining knowledge, they go through government works and all those stuff. but creativity can be more independent. all right, so creativity is more. knowledge is more restricted. you gain knowledge from someone else. creativity is inbound, inborn, right. it's something that just comes from within, correct? yes. okay. so the debate over whether creativity or knowledge is more important has been a long standing topic of discussion among philosophers, scholars, and innovators. both creativity and knowledge are essential elements in our lives. you agree with me on that, but there is no consensus on which one should be given more weights. well, if you are to ask me, i would say both are very important. you need knowledge. you, you. it's good to be creativity. you need. you actually need knowledge to apply the creative aspect that you have. exactly. you need that knowledge. but if you have only knowledge, without creativity, you are just like any other person. there's nothing special about you. you need to be creative for your knowledge to stand out. so, on one hand, knowledge is often perceived as the foundation of progress and advancement, while on the other hand, creativity is viewed as the driving force between innovation and originalism. in this ongoing debate, some believe that knowledge enables individuals to think critically and solve problems efficiently, while others argue that creativity allows for the exploration of new ideas and solutions. ultimately, the importance of creativity and knowledge may depend on individual perspectives and context. so now for the. i want to ask you a question. what do you think is the key to success? is it being creative or having vast knowledge on a topic. both are more important, but i think it leans more towards creativity in the current society that we are being creative, because knowledge. knowledge is some. the knowledge is the key to success, but when that knowledge isn't able to be applied practically, won't really have any effect in society. okay, so you. creativity has a higher standing in the. if you have to put it in the balance, creativity will be weighing higher, right? yes. okay, i agree with you on that. so what has been your personal experience in balancing creativity and knowledge in your work or personal life. like creative creativity. i'm still a second, i'm still a university student, but when it comes to creativity, i'm more focused on artwork and stuff like that. all right, so how you are more focused on artwork. right. but you talked about you being a secondary school student, right or university student right. okay, so you do know that there's a way to apply creativity into your studies. yes, there is. you know? right. so what comes, what kind of methods have you thought about and have you tried applying them? i personally, i haven't applied any creative aspect to my, my university life, but i think when applying creativity to your university life, stuff like engineering. when it comes to engineering, there are some stuff you can do outside of academic work that can help you earn money and stuff like that. okay. okay. yeah. being a bit fake, but i think i understand what you're trying to say. for me, when i think about creativity in studies, i'm thinking about, oh, how you and i are reading for both reason. reading for 12 hours, right. in a day. let's just assume that i read every 12 hours in a day. you also read 12 hours in a day. you read a whole 12 hours in a stretch. maybe you only take breaks to eat or have a short nap or something like that, but then i read for the same 12 hours. but then maybe every 30 minutes i take a break, i just draw something, i scribble something down, or i just write a design or look up a dag, a cursive handwriting, a new course of handwriting and put it down. you know, just things that fancy my fancy, fancy my liking. for me, it's art. for somebody else, it might be music. so you might just take that break and use to bring your brain back to recover your brain, you know, drag your brain. because the truth is that when you study, your brain tends to wear like your brain is being strained. so you have to bring jack your

My name is Amina and I consent to the recording of this audio and together with me is? Hafsa, also consent for the recording of this audio. Okay. So, dear Hafsa, I want us to discuss about what makes a good leader. Alright. I think a leader is a person that many people are under him. He is responsible for, he is responsible for the so many administrations. So then how can we know that this is a good leader? Well, well, well, this is a broad topic, actually, but let's just talk, you know, basically. Not actually the practical terms. So basically, when you say someone is a good leader, we need to talk of his dignity, you know, definitely dignity inside honesty, you know, generosity. Plenty of stuff, actually. But then how can we know that this is an honest person? He's generous. Well, it's very hard, actually, because, you know, politics, let's say leaders, when they are looking for positions, you know, they tend to form holy, holy. Yes, I've witnessed lots, lots of incidents. So you see, you just have to work with what you can see. But then think beyond that, actually. But then, okay, then, a good leader, I think based on me, if we are looking for a good leader, we need to check for the quality, such as his ability to guide, honesty, as you said, generosity. And is it man of his word? Yes, yes politeness, is it, is this person a harsh person? It shouldn't actually be entirely polite. We need some, as a leader, you have to be. yes, polite somehow, but then you have to be somehow strict. So in between, something in between, actually. Because his administration can decide to share some. Yes. Then what if after voting, the leader happens to fail from what he said he would do? Maybe we find out that he's a bad leader. Then what do you think can we do? Can we just impeach him? Or we have to wait? Or are we supposed to fight him? Well, let's take most of African, let's say a democratically operating system. The impeachment is actually left for the Senate. They are our representatives. Then they decide what to do. Maybe when they hear about the complaints. That is, in theoretical aspect, that you can find that in a constitution, let's say for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, you can impeach a president or a leader. But then that's basically to be honest in theoretical terms, in practical aspect. Now, if you're talking about peers, if. you're. You are to dive into the practical. It's very hard, actually. Honestly. We had a professor taking us a course. What he actually said that the only reasonable, practical thing you can do about it is just to be patient, you know, all those protests or whatever. Yes, this patient that you said, you just. Have to be, I'm coming, I'm coming. You just have to be patient and then wait for the next period of election and then don't vote for that person into power again. So basically that's the most. What if it's in a hard time? Do you think that patiently waiting, won't it say there is. What do you think a common man is going to do about it? What do you think a common man is going to do about it? He has no power. Yes, he has some rights. Let's talk. Okay, let's not dive into, you know, but let me give you an example so that you understand where I'm headed. Let's take Nigeria as a case study. In the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, your fundamental human rights are guaranteed, and also there are some rights that is right to education, you know, right to, right to, right to health, health, right to quality water. It is your right. But do you know that that same constitution that granted you that right under section two also limited that thing. That you cannot go to court of law to enforce that right. That means you cannot go to court of law to say that this leader has not provided me with quality water. Therefore I call for enforcement of my right. That same constitution has prohibited that. So tell me then, what is the hope of the common man? Patience. You just have to be patient. Do you say you'll come out and riot, you know, yeah, you can do peaceful protest, but then what does it result to actually does it profer solution? I don't think so. The practical thing is just to be patient and then vote for the next senior and then don't vote for that person. Yes, yes. So what practically you are supposed to do then before you vote that particular person, don't go beyond, you know, they give. you spaghetti and then you just go and vote. Just be reasonable, you know, try to see, do you see potential in this person and then vote it so that's. Yes, Let's talk about our own beliefs. Our own beliefs, let's say my own beliefs. What are the values that I want to see in a leader? A leader, I think based on my own, the values that I want to see in a leader, he should be trustworthy. That's the most important thing I think. Trustworthy. Yes, actually that's why I keep on repeating in theoretical time, how are you going to know that this person is actually a trustworthy? Research based on the previous, let's say, offices he holds, his previous activities. Yes, we know that a human being can change. But, you know, let's say he, he stayed in office for 20 years. Then definitely, if you want to go to research deeply, we will know what he did in that office for the past 20 years. What do you think is. Am I making sense? Well, you are making sense, actually but then. Yes, that's my only. Have some traits of you know, corruption. Yes, definitely, one way or the other, That's incapacity, human incapacity. But then if we are to check, we will know that, yes, this is better than that. That is better than that person. You know, we cannot say all humans are equal. Definitely. There's a better person and there's the worst person. Okay. Then apart from trustworthy, I think the next thing that's supposed to be is, the next person, the next quality that we have to check for is, what, what do you think? Tolerance. Right? You know that tolerance. I'm not actually sure. Okay. When you say tolerance, does that mean a leader should tolerate any rubbish? No. Level of tolerance. Level. You know, there's level to everything. Let's say there's, he's, if he's not able to tolerate people, let's say, for example, he went to a particular place to see his people, and then they started shouting, we no they do, we no they do. Do you think that if he's not, he will not tolerate them, he will say, maybe his soldiers should start shooting them. So there's a level of tolerance. Yeah, to some extent. To some extent, yes. And then a leader should have this, What? I don't know how to put this, but then he should be, he should have this quality that he loves his people. Yeah. He should be patriotic to his nation and all that. Which I think puts your, you know, your subjects, the people you are leading, that is, carry them. They should be your utmost priority. Yes So we hope for good leaders, and we pray that our leaders will continue to be patriotic Amen. Amen. So help us God. Yes. So, in conclusion, can you just tell us briefly what leaders, our leaders should do to us? What they should give back to their community. And they should provide necessary amenities, you know, health, education and all that. And also they should work on trying to see that our fundamental human rights are being duly followed, you know, duly observed. Exactly. Yes. I think that's basically what they're supposed to do. Know that they should make sure that their people have food. That's the important thing. They should remove their people from poverty. Poverty alleviation. I think we've done a little bit justice to the topic. Right? Well, we've practically, we've done justice to it. Alright? So thank you. Thank you for coming on board with me.",good afternoon my name is i mean and i consent to the recording of this audio and together with me so it's a half so i want us to discuss about what makes a good leader i think a leader is a person that many people are under him he is responsible for he's responsible for these so many administrations so then we know that this is a good leader this is a broad topic not actually the practical terms so basically when you see someone is a good leader we need to talk of his dignity definitely of then how come you know that is a person who generos well it's very hard actually because you know politics let's see leaders when they're looking for positions you know the tend to form lots lots of just have to work with what you can see but then think beyond that i think for good we need to check for the quality so his ability to guide honesty as you said generosity and is this a man of his ward politeness is this person a high person shouldn't actually be entirely polite too we need some as a leader you have to be polite somehow but then you have to be somehow strict so in between something in between actually 'cause his administration can share some then what's even after voting the leader happens to fail from what he said he would do maybe we find from found out that he's a bad leader then what do you think can we do can we just impeach him or we we'll have to wait or are we supposed to fight him well let's say um most of african let's say democratically operating system but impeachment is actually left for the senate there are representatives then you decide what to do maybe when they hear about the conflict that is intuitive aspect that you can find in a construction let's say for the federal public of nigeria you can impeach a president but then there's basically to be honest in prac in terms in practical aspect now if you're talking about to dive into the practice it's very hard actually honestly we had a professor taking us across what he actually said that the only reasonable practical thing you can do about it is just be patient you know all those protests or whatever you said so i'm just to be i'm coming i'm you just have to be patient and then wait for the next period of election and then don't vote for that person into power the most what if it's in a hard time do you think that patiently waiting for what you think a common money what do you think a common money is going to do about it he has no power yes he has some rights some let's talk of okay let's not dive into but let's let me give you an example so that you understand where i'm nigeria as a key story in the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria your fundamental human rights are guaranteed and also there are some rights that is right to education you know right to health right to quality water it is your right but you know that that same constitution that grants and you dutch right under section two also limited that you cannot go to court of law to enforce that right that meant a court of law to see that this leader has not provided me with quality water therefore i call force and of my right that same constitution has prohibited that so tell me then what is the hope of the common man patience you just have to be patient do you say you come out and riot you know ya you can do peaceful protect but then what does it result to actually does it profess solution i don't think it's just to be patient and then don't vote for that person what practically you are supposed to do that before you vote that particular person don't go beyond you give you spaghetti many people just be reasonable you know potential in this person let's talk about our own believes let's say my own believes what values i want to see in a leader a leader it's in based on my own the values that i want to see in a leader he should be trustworthy does the most important in trust yes how are you going to move that this person actually research based on the previous let's see offices he holds his previous activities yes we know that can change you know let's say he he stayed in office for twenty then definitely for to go to research deeply know what he did in that office for the past twenty years what do you think is i'm a consensus you are making but then i all my years i don't have some treats of you know corruption way although incapacity but then if we are to chat this better than that that is better than that person you know we cannot say all mans are equal definitely there's a better person and there's a wall person given apart from trustworthy i think the next thing that's supposed to be do that person the next quality to check for is what do you think tolerance right you when you see tolerance does that mean that you don't tolerate any rubbish your level of tolerance level you know and level everything let's say if he's not able to tolerate people let's say for example he went to a particular place to see his people and then they started shouting we know they do we know do you think that if he's not tolerate if he will not tolerate them he will say maybe he sold us should start should level of color some and then a leader should help what i don't know how to put this but then he should be sure of this quality does he loves his people ya he should be patriotic to his nation which i think your um your subject the people who are leading that carry them they should be your utmost priority ya so we hope for good leaders and we pray that our leaders continue to be

afternoon. my name is amina and i consent to the recording of this audio and together with me is? hafsa, also consent for the recording of this audio. okay. so, dear hafsa, i want us to discuss about what makes a good leader. alright. i think a leader is a person that many people are under him. he is responsible for, he is responsible for the so many administrations. so then how can we know that this is a good leader? well, well, well, this is a broad topic, actually, but let's just talk, you know, basically. not actually the practical terms. so basically, when you say someone is a good leader, we need to talk of his dignity, you know, definitely dignity inside honesty, you know, generosity. plenty of stuff, actually. but then how can we know that this is an honest person? he's generous. well, it's very hard, actually, because, you know, politics, let's say leaders, when they are looking for positions, you know, they tend to form holy, holy. yes, i've witnessed lots, lots of incidents. so you see, you just have to work with what you can see. but then think beyond that, actually. but then, okay, then, a good leader, i think based on me, if we are looking for a good leader, we need to check for the quality, such as his ability to guide, honesty, as you said, generosity. and is it man of his word? yes, yes politeness, is it, is this person a harsh person? it shouldn't actually be entirely polite. we need some, as a leader, you have to be. yes, polite somehow, but then you have to be somehow strict. so in between, something in between, actually. because his administration can decide to share some. yes. then what if after voting, the leader happens to fail from what he said he would do? maybe we find out that he's a bad leader. then what do you think can we do? can we just impeach him? or we have to wait? or are we supposed to fight him? well, let's take most of african, let's say a democratically operating system. the impeachment is actually left for the senate. they are our representatives. then they decide what to do. maybe when they hear about the complaints. that is, in theoretical aspect, that you can find that in a constitution, let's say for the federal republic of nigeria, you can impeach a president or a leader. but then that's basically to be honest in theoretical terms, in practical aspect. now, if you're talking about peers, if. you're. you are to dive into the practical. it's very hard, actually. honestly. we had a professor taking us a course. what he actually said that the only reasonable, practical thing you can do about it is just to be patient, you know, all those protests or whatever. yes, this patient that you said, you just. have to be, i'm coming, i'm coming. you just have to be patient and then wait for the next period of election and then don't vote for that person into power again. so basically that's the most. what if it's in a hard time? do you think that patiently waiting, won't it say there is. what do you think a common man is going to do about it? what do you think a common man is going to do about it? he has no power. yes, he has some rights. let's talk. okay, let's not dive into, you know, but let me give you an example so that you understand where i'm headed. let's take nigeria as a case study. in the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria, your fundamental human rights are guaranteed, and also there are some rights that is right to education, you know, right to, right to, right to health, health, right to quality water. it is your right. but do you know that that same constitution that granted you that right under section two also limited that thing. that you cannot go to court of law to enforce that right. that means you cannot go to court of law to say that this leader has not provided me with quality water. therefore i call for enforcement of my right. that same constitution has prohibited that. so tell me then, what is the hope of the common man? patience. you just have to be patient. do you say you'll come out and riot, you know, yeah, you can do peaceful protest, but then what does it result to actually does it profer solution? i don't think so. the practical thing is just to be patient and then vote for the next senior and then don't vote for that person. yes, yes. so what practically you are supposed to do then before you vote that particular person, don't go beyond, you know, they give. you spaghetti and then you just go and vote. just be reasonable, you know, try to see, do you see potential in this person and then vote it so that's. yes, let's talk about our own beliefs. our own beliefs, let's say my own beliefs. what are the values that i want to see in a leader? a leader, i think based on my own, the values that i want to see in a leader, he should be trustworthy. that's the most important thing i think. trustworthy. yes, actually that's why i keep on repeating in theoretical time, how are you going to know that this person is actually a trustworthy? research based on the previous, let's say, offices he holds, his previous activities. yes, we know that a human being can change. but, you know, let's say he, he stayed in office for 20 years. then definitely, if you want to go to research deeply, we will know what he did in that office for the past 20 years. what do you think is. am i making sense? well, you are making sense, actually but then. yes, that's my only. have some traits of you know, corruption. yes, definitely, one way or the other, that's incapacity, human incapacity. but then if we are to check, we will know that, yes, this is better than that. that is better than that person. you know, we cannot say all humans are equal. definitely. there's a better person and there's the worst person. okay. then apart from trustworthy, i think the next thing that's supposed to be is, the next person, the next quality that we have to check for is, what, what do you think? tolerance. right? you know that tolerance. i'm not actually sure. okay. when you say tolerance, does that mean a leader should tolerate any rubbish? no. level of tolerance. level. you know, there's level to everything. let's say there's, he's, if he's not able to tolerate people, let's say, for example, he went to a particular place to see his people, and then they started shouting, we no they do, we no they do. do you think that if he's not, he will not tolerate them, he will say, maybe his soldiers should start shooting them. so there's a level of tolerance. yeah, to some extent. to some extent, yes. and then a leader should have this, what? i don't know how to put this, but then he should be, he should have this quality that he loves his people. yeah. he should be patriotic to his nation and all that. which i think puts your, you know, your subjects, the people you are leading, that is, carry them. they should be your utmost priority. yes so we hope for good leaders, and we pray that our leaders will continue to be patriotic amen. amen. so help us god. yes. so, in conclusion, can you just tell us briefly what leaders, our leaders should do to us? what they should give back to their community. and they should provide necessary amenities, you know, health, education and all that. and also they should work on trying to see that our fundamental human rights are being duly followed, you know, duly observed. exactly. yes. i think that's basically what they're supposed to do. know that they should make sure that their people have food. that's the important thing. they should remove their people from poverty. poverty alleviation. i think we've done a little bit justice to the topic. right? well, we've practically, we've done justice to it. alright? so thank you. thank you for coming on

corruption yes definitely one way or the other that is incapacity human incapacity but then if we are to check we will know that yes this is better than that that is better than that person you know we cannot say all humans are equal definitely there is a better person and there is the worst person okay then apart from trustworthy i think the next thing that is supposed to be is the next person the next quality that we have to check for is what what do you think tolerance right you know that tolerance i am not actually sure okay when you say tolerance does that mean a leader should tolerate any rubbish no level of tolerance level you know there is level to everything let us say there is he is if he is not able to tolerate people let us say for example he went to a particular place to see his people and then they started shouting we no they do we no they do do you think that if he is not he will not tolerate them he will say maybe his soldiers should start shooting them so there is a level of tolerance yeah to some extent to some extent yes and then a leader should have this what i do not know how to put this but then he should be he should have this quality that he loves his people yeah he should be patriotic to his nation and all that which i think puts your you know your subjects the people you are leading that is carry them they should be your utmost priority yes so we hope for good leaders and we pray that our leaders will continue to be patriotic amen amen so help us god yes so in conclusion can you just tell us briefly what leaders our leaders should do to us what they should give back to their community and they should provide necessary amenities you know health education and all that and also they should work on trying to see that our fundamental human rights are being duly followed you know duly observed exactly yes i think that is basically what they are supposed to do know that they should make sure that their people have food that is the important thing they should remove their people from poverty poverty alleviation i think we have done a little bit justice to the topic right well we have practically we have done justice to it alright so thank you thank you for coming on board with me

I consent to recording this audio conversation. My name is Haruna Nuhu. I also consent to recording this audio conversation. Thank you so much for joining in the conversation. The topic I would like us to discuss how the western culture has affected African dressing. You see, Mr Haruna, over the centuries, the western culture has had a significant impact on African dressing. Isn't it so? Yeah, of course. Yeah. So from the arrival of european explorers and missionaries to the influence of colonialism and the spread of western media and pop culture, the traditional attire and fashion of african cultures have been greatly influenced and adapted. Also, you see, the influence of western culture on african dressing has been profound, reshaping traditional attire and fashion trends in multi faceted ways from historical encounters to contemporary global interactions. This cultural exchange has produced a dynamic fusion of western and African styles, altering both aesthetics and production of clothing across the continent. And so now over to you, Mr Haruna. Do you have anything to say about how the western culture has affected the African dressing in any way? Thank you very much, Fatima. Yes, of course, you know, I have a lot to say regarding this discussion or this topic, but I think, first of all, I would like you to, you know, first of all, you know, go through this question. You know, I know you are a professional, so I want you to, you know, enlighten us and, and educators briefly regarding this question. I'm going to ask you now, Fatima. I would like you to. What are your thoughts on how the influence of western culture has changed traditional African dressing styles and fashion trends? Do you think it has a positive or negative impact on preserving cultural identity through clothing? Wow. Nice question, Mister Haruna. Okay, you asked the impact on traditional African dressing styles, right? And cultural identity, isn't it? Yeah. You see, the impact of western culture on traditional african dressing styles has been extensive. You see, western fashion trends have introduced new materials, new designs and even new, you know, tailoring techniques into african clothing. Take for instance, the adoption of western style suits, dresses and casual wears has become prevalent, especially in urban centers. And this fusion has created a diverse and electic fashion scene in Africa, you know, blending indigenous motifs with modern cuts and fabrics. However, this influence has, you know, also raised concerns about the preservation of cultural identity through clothing. As western fashion gains prominence, there is a risk of diluting or overshadowing traditional African attire. And some argue that this shift undermines cultural authenticity and erodes unique sartorial practices that reflect african heritage. Yet others see it as, you know, a cultural evolution showcasing Africa's adaptability and creativity in responding to global influences while maintaining cultural roots. So I think this is the little I can say for now. And, okay, over to you, Mr Haruna, what exactly is. Is one specific aspect or element of traditional African attire that you think has been influenced or adapted by western culture? So tell me, I want you to tell me, how do you feel about this incorporation and its impact on the overall style of African dressings? All right, thank you so much, Fatima, for allowing me to say one or two things regarding this topic. You know, incorporation of traditional elements in western influence, Africa dressing. You know, one specific aspect of traditional Africa attire that has been, you know, influenced by western culture is the use of textiles, you know, and print, print and print, you know, traditional, traditional African fabrics like kanti, moth clothes and Ankara, you understand, have gained international recognition. Yes. Yes. And now, you know, incorporated into western fashion designs. So, you know, and this closer cultural exchange has elevated the status of Africa textiles globally and showcasing the beauty and craftsmanship of indigenous weaving and dying techniques. You know, the inco incorporate. The incorporation of our traditional element into western influence. African dressing has had a positive impact on the overall style. It has empowered, African designers to interpret traditional motives in contemporary context, appealing to broader audience while celebrating cultural heritage. This hybrid approach, this hybrid approach of fashion exemplifies the spirit of cultural fashion and innovation, you know, highlighting Africans rich history and creativity on the. On the. On the global stage. So, yeah, so I think, Fatima, can you make a conclusion, you know, regarding this topic we have just discussed so far? Okay. All right. Thank you for your contribution. Thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you. You see, it's essential, actually, to acknowledge the agency of African communities in navigating cultural exchanges and shaping their identity through clothing. You see, while western influence has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on African dressing, the ongoing dialogue between traditional and modernity continues to inspire new forms of sartorial expression that are both culturally rooted and globally resonant. Okay. This interplay underscores the transformative power of fashion as a conduct of, you know, cultural exchange, self expression in a rapid changing world. So I would like us to give a pause here.

My name is Victor. I consent to recording this conversation. Right, Victor? You're welcome. Today we'll be talking about something that is popular, that is cut across almost all the cultures. Something that a lot of people know about. And many people always look forward to it. Victor, can you guess? I can't guess. Okay. Is it birthday? Exactly. Victor will be talking about birthday today. So I know that everybody alive has a birthday. But this time around, I don't know if everybody alive really does the birthday celebration type of thing. So, Victor, can I know what you think of birthday? What do you understand as birthday? Or what's? What's your simple explanation or definition of a birthday? Birthday, in the simplest definition, is a special day set apart to remember the day you were born. And its mostly held on the month and the dates that you were giving birth to. Your official date of birth. Okay, so birthday is something that people. celebrate every year right? To remember the other year or the other, other, other year that they were giving birth to. Yeah. Okay and its celebrated the same day and month. Okay, so, Victor, this birthday celebration, I learned that its for only rich people, that poor people don't celebrate birthday. Do you think that is true? Poor people don't celebrate birthday. Actually, actually its subjective, because some rich people don't like celebrating their birthday. Okay. But I'll not remove the fact that to celebrate your birthday, you actually need money. So, some people, because of their poor, they have many problems in their lives, so birthday is the least of their worries. So, the highest they can get on their birthday is just a happy birthday. But most times they just even forget their birthday because they're going through a lot. So birthday is the last thing on their mind. So what you're saying is that a lot of people don't remember to really celebrate their birthday probably because of what they are facing. Yes. Okay, Victor, can I know when last you celebrated your birthday? Just a few months ago. Few months ago? Yes. Okay, so that few months ago, did you really remember that it was your birthday or someone reminded you? No, I remembered. I remembered. But obviously, sometimes I used to forget it's my birthday. Like, the previous year, I forgot it was my birthday. My birthday passed. Like, can you imagine, like, for somebody to forget the day they were born. Like, I didn't put too much value into birthday, because I felt birthday is just an ordinary day like, it's just. So if I should be sadistic, some people do view birthdays as one year closer to your death. So to them its not something special. Just another day, just a day they were born. Nothing much. Nothing. Nothing to see there. Alright. So you, few months ago, you celebrated your birthday. Can I know, Victor, if there is any of those, your birthdays that you find very, very special or the one that had some events that made you, it very memorable for you. That you can say, I can't forget my second two years old birthday, three years old birthday or any of those. I can't actually remember the year or the age I was in but I'll not call it my personal birthday. Because on my personal birthday, the highest they did for me, was happy birthday and it ends there. Nothing special. Maybe my mom bought chicken that day and we cooked it, just a remembrance of me and ended there. No special events, no special stuff happened but something later happened. Because few weeks after that, my parents decided to do a general birthday to celebrate everybody in our house. So we did it in a large way. My parents invited people to our house, our compound. We celebrated all our birthdays in one day. I know it's funny it's funny yeah. It does not normally happen in some families. Family of Victor Demas. It does not happen in some families but my father had to do it and that day, something special happened. My father did us a special surprise. He bought us really expensive, table tennis board where we can use and play table tennis. So up to date, that table tennis is still there. So, I think that was the most memorable birthday celebration. Even though it was not my birthday. It was a family birthday. It was the most memorable. Something close to a memory birthday I had. So say the one that you people had generally as a family was your most memorable birthday. Wow. So outside that, your normal birthday, what, don't you think about, cake? Because, I learned that, I see that most people, they see birthday as a day that they have to purchase cake or eat cake or I, share cakes to their friends. Do you think that without cake there will be no birthday or something? Birthday celebration. Do you think that cake is extremely necessary for birthday? That people cannot celebrate birthday without cake? Birthday is a symbol of, sorry, cake is a symbol of birthdays. Like, it's something attached to birthdays. Like, literally, if you see a cake with candles in a picture, obviously, you know, it was, its used to remember somebody's birthday. It signifies birthday. Just like, chicken, like turkey, represents Easter, thanksgivings. Yeah. Same way with bunnies represents Easter thanksgiving. Rice, rice and stew represent Sundays. That's Nigeria only. Nigeria only. So cake represent birthdays. It's, it's, I don't know where the tradition started, but it has been there for a long time. Do you think it's Nigerian tradition or it's foreign? Should be foreign because our old fathers never knew what cake was. Okay, so how do you think that your old father celebrated their birthday? Or they don't celebrate birthday? I don't think they celebrated their birthday. So what you're saying that birthday is not a tradition of your ancestral home? Because if you ask some of these, our great grandfathers and our grandfathers that are still alive, some people are lucky to have their grandfathers. That's, that's actually good. So, but if you ask them, most of them don't know their age. Okay. They don't know their age and that just tells you that they don't keep track of their age and if they don't keep the track of age, obviously they were not celebrating their birthday. They were not being reminded that this was the day they were born. Because if they were remembering this, was the day they're born, they will not, they will actually remember the dates they were born and they will be able to calculate their age. So they don't really put much emphasis in birthday, then. Wow, the old people really missed a lot. So old people, I think that's true, actually, because I barely remember that when my grandmother died, we had to guess her age by estimate. It wasn't really her exact age that was written on the poster. So we have to go through her age mates to discover maybe the age, her age. Yeah. So if you have kids, would you like to introduce them to birthday celebration? If I have kids, obviously. Are you, will you celebrate them just normal, happy birthday, like you were raised. To have a limit for the first few years of their life, I'll be celebrating a birthday, but, as they grow older, I think I'll dial down on the way I celebrate their birthday. You can just be happy, wish then and maybe send them money. If I'm capable, I'll be sending them money. Happy birthday, take this as your birthday gift, that kind of thing. But not to come and do a ceremony to celebrate a birthday. But it's very essential you do a ceremonious birthday for your kids in their first few years of life. Maybe their first birthday, second birthday, fifth birthday, 6th birthday. But as a grow older, the birthday ceremonies thing, you can dial it down the beach and just do like a small gifting to them just to remind them that you love them and make them feel special on their birthday. Okay? So what you're saying is that those early age of their life where they take pictures and all that, that is very necessary that you celebrate their birthday for them, at least for the sake of memory. Alright, Victor, I appreciate your input on this issue of birthday. So I believe to see you around again for more discussion. Thank you so much, Victor. Yeah, thank you very much.",my name is i consent to recording this conversation my name is victor i consent to recording this conversation right victor you're welcome today we'll be talking about something that is popular that is cut across all the cultures something that a lot of people know about and many people always look forward to eat victoria guessing that exactly we're talking about know that everybody alive has a birthday but this time around i don't know if everybody alive really does the birthday celebration type of thing so victor can i know what you think of birthday what do you understand as birthday or worse was your simple explanation or definition of bed in this simple definition is especially set apart remember you were born and mostly held on the moot and the deeds that you were giving birth to your official date of birth oh okay so that day is something that people celebrate every year right to remember the order year or the order order that they were given birth to ya okay and it celebrated the same day and month okay so victor this this celebration um i learnt that it's for only rich people that poor people don't celebrate birthday do you think that is true poor people don't celebrate birthday um actually actually subjective because some rich people don't like celebrating their birthday okay but i'll not remove the fact that celebrates your birthday you actually need money mm so um some people because of their poor they have many problems in their life so bedded is the least of their worries so um the highest they can get on their bedded just a happy bed and most time they just won't forget their bed because they've going through a lot so bad day is the last thing on their mind mm so what you're saying is that a lot of people don't remember to really celebrate their bedding probably because of what they're facing yes victor can i know when last you celebrated your just a few months ago few months ago few months ago did you really remember that it was your birthday or someone reminded you but i remember but obviously sometimes i used to forget it's my bedding like the previous day i forgot it was my bedding my dead beddy passed like can you imagine like somebody to forget the day they were born like i didn't put too much value into beddy cause i felt bad is just an ordinary day like it just so if i'm should be sadistic some people do view that days as one year closer to your debts so to them that day is not something special okay just another day just a day whereby nothing much nothing nothing to see there alright so you few months ago you celebrated your birthday can i know victor if there is any of those your birthdays that you find very very special or the one that had some event that made you eat very memorable for you that you can say i can't forget my second two years old bedded three years old bed day or any of i can't actually remember the year or the age i was in i'll not call it my best not that cause my best not that day the highest the date for me was a happy birthday and special maybe my mom bought chicken that the cooked seat just in members of me and ended there no special events no special

like literally if you see a cake with candles in a picture obviously you know it was used to remember somebody's birthday signifies birdie just like chicken like turkey represents easter thanksgiving

around again for more discussion thank you so much victor yeah thank you very much,"my name is ovoba. i consent to recording this conversation. my name is victor. i consent to recording this conversation. right, victor? you're welcome. today we'll be talking about something that is popular, that is cut across almost all the cultures. something that a lot of people know about. and many people always look forward to it. victor, can you guess? i can't guess. okay. is it birthday? exactly. victor will be talking about birthday today. so i know that everybody alive has a birthday. but this time around, i don't know if everybody alive really does the birthday celebration type of thing. so, victor, can i know what you think of birthday? what do you understand as birthday? or what's? what's your simple explanation or definition of a birthday? birthday, in the simplest definition, is a special day set apart to remember the day you were born. and its mostly held on the month and the dates that you were giving birth to. your official date of birth. okay, so birthday is something that people. celebrate every year right? to remember the other year or the other, other, other year that they were giving birth to. yeah. okay and its celebrated the same day and month. okay, so, victor, this birthday celebration, i learned that its for only rich people, that poor people don't celebrate birthday. do you think that is true? poor people don't celebrate birthday. actually, actually its subjective, because some rich people don't like celebrating their birthday. okay. but i'll not remove the fact that to celebrate your birthday, you actually need money. so, some people, because of their poor, they have many problems in their lives, so birthday is the least of their worries. so, the highest they can get on their birthday is just a happy birthday. but most times they just even forget their birthday because they're going through a lot. so birthday is the last thing on their mind. so what you're saying is that a lot of people don't remember to really celebrate their birthday probably because of what they are facing. yes. okay, victor, can i know when last you celebrated your birthday? just a few months ago. few months ago? yes. okay, so that few months ago, did you really remember that it was your birthday or someone reminded you? no, i remembered. i remembered. but obviously, sometimes i used to forget it's my birthday. like, the previous year, i forgot it was my birthday. my birthday passed. like, can you imagine, like, for somebody to forget the day they were born. like, i didn't put too much value into birthday, because i felt birthday is just an ordinary day like, it's just. so if i should be sadistic, some people do view birthdays as one year closer to your death. so to them its not something special. just another day, just a day they were born. nothing much. nothing. nothing to see there. alright. so you, few months ago, you celebrated your birthday. can i know, victor, if there is any of those, your birthdays that you find very, very special or the one that had some events that made you, it very memorable for you. that you can say, i can't forget my second two years old birthday, three years old birthday or any of those. i can't actually remember the year or the age i was in but i'll not call it my personal birthday. because on my personal birthday, the highest they did for me, was happy birthday and it ends there. nothing special. maybe my mom bought chicken that day and we cooked it, just a remembrance of me and ended there. no special events, no special stuff happened but something later happened. because few weeks after that, my parents decided to do a general birthday to celebrate everybody in our house. so we did it in a large way. my parents invited people to our house, our compound. we celebrated all our birthdays in one day. i know it's funny it's funny yeah. it does not normally happen in some families. family of victor demas. it does not happen in some families but my father had to do it and that day, something special happened. my father did us a special surprise. he bought us really expensive, table tennis board where we can use and play table tennis. so up to date, that table tennis is still there. so, i think that was the most memorable birthday celebration. even though it was not my birthday. it was a family birthday. it was the most memorable. something close to a memory birthday i had. so say the one that you people had generally as a family was your most memorable birthday. wow. so outside that, your normal birthday, what, don't you think about, cake? because, i learned that, i see that most people, they see birthday as a day that they have to purchase cake or eat cake or i, share cakes to their friends. do you think that without cake there will be no birthday or something? birthday celebration. do you think that cake is extremely necessary for birthday? that people cannot celebrate birthday without cake? birthday is a symbol of, sorry, cake is a symbol of birthdays. like, it's something attached to birthdays. like, literally, if you see a cake with candles in a

represents easter thanksgiving. rice, rice and stew represent sundays. that's nigeria only. nigeria only. so cake represent birthdays. it's, it's, i don't know where the tradition started, but it has been there for a long time. do you think it's nigerian tradition or it's foreign? should be foreign because our old fathers never knew what cake was. okay, so how do you think that your old father celebrated their birthday? or they don't celebrate birthday? i don't think they celebrated their birthday. so what you're saying that birthday is not a tradition of your ancestral home? because if you ask some of these, our great grandfathers and our grandfathers that are still alive, some people are lucky to have their grandfathers. that's, that's actually good. so, but if you ask them, most of them don't know their age. okay. they don't know their age and that just tells you that they don't keep track of their age and if they don't keep the track of age, obviously they were not celebrating their birthday. they were not being reminded that this was the day they were born. because if they were remembering this, was the day they're born, they will not, they will actually remember the dates

actually, because i barely remember that when my grandmother died, we had to guess her age by estimate. it wasn't really her exact age that was written on the poster. so we have to go through her age

there nothing special maybe my mom bought chicken that day and we cooked it just a remembrance of me and ended there no special events no special stuff happened but something later happened because few weeks after that my parents decided to do a general birthday to celebrate everybody in our house so we did it in a large way my parents invited people to our house our compound we celebrated all our birthdays in one day i know it is funny it is funny yeah it does not normally happen in some families family of victor demas it does not happen in some families but my father had to do it and that day something special happened my father did us a special surprise he bought us really expensive table tennis board where we can use and play table tennis so up to date that table tennis is still there so i think that was the most memorable birthday celebration even though it was not my birthday it was a family birthday it was the most memorable something close to a memory birthday i had so say the one that you people had generally as a family was your most memorable birthday wow so outside that your normal birthday what do not you think about cake because i learned that i see that most people they see birthday as a day that they have to purchase cake or eat cake or i share cakes to their friends do you think that without cake there will be no birthday or something birthday celebration do you think that cake is extremely necessary for birthday that people cannot celebrate birthday without cake birthday is a symbol of sorry cake is a symbol of birthdays like it is something attached to birthdays like literally if you see a cake with candles in a picture obviously you know it was its used to remember somebody is birthday it signifies birthday just like chicken like turkey represents easter thanksgivings yeah same way with bunnies represents easter thanksgiving rice rice and stew represent sundays that is nigeria only nigeria only so cake represent birthdays it is it is i do not know where the tradition started but it has been there for a long time do you think it is nigerian tradition or it is foreign should be foreign because our old fathers never knew what cake was okay so how do you think that your old father celebrated their birthday or they do not celebrate birthday i do not think they celebrated their birthday so what you are saying that birthday is not a tradition of your ancestral home because if you ask some of these our great grandfathers and our grandfathers that are still alive some people are lucky to have their grandfathers that is that is actually good so but if you ask them most of them do not know their age okay they do not know their age and that just tells you that they do not keep track of their age and if they do not keep the track of age obviously they were not celebrating their birthday they were not being reminded that this was the day they were born because if they were remembering this was the day they are born they will not they will actually remember the dates they were born and they will be able to calculate their age so they do not really put much emphasis in birthday then wow the old people really missed a lot so old people i think that is true actually because i barely remember that when my grandmother died we had to guess her age by estimate it was not really her exact age that was written on the poster so we have to go through her age mates to discover maybe the age her age yeah so if you have kids would you like to introduce them to birthday celebration if i have kids obviously are you will you celebrate them just normal happy birthday like you were raised to have a limit for the 1st few years of their life i will be celebrating a birthday but as they grow older i think i will dial down on the way i celebrate their birthday you can just be happy wish then and maybe send them money if i am capable i will be sending them money happy birthday take this as your birthday gift that kind of thing but not to come and do a ceremony to celebrate a birthday but it is very essential you do a ceremonious birthday for your kids in their 1st few years of life maybe their 1st birthday 2nd birthday 5th birthday 6th birthday but as a grow older the birthday ceremonies thing you can dial it down the beach and just do like a small gifting to them just to remind them that you love them and make them feel special on their birthday okay so what you are saying is that those early age of their life where they take pictures and all that that is very necessary that you celebrate their birthday for them at least for the sake of memory alright victor i appreciate your input on this issue of birthday so i believe to see you around again for more discussion thank you so much victor yeah thank you very much

My name is Precious, and I consent to recording this conversation. Okay, so we'll be looking at heart diseases, and by way of introduction, we see that heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and its functions. These include coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects, among others. Now, do you have anything to say about that? Okay. Heart disease is recently one of the sudden causes of death in our environment. And like you said, it ranges from diseases like myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, congenital defects as well, and usually a compendium of diseases that affect the heart and the blood vessels and have a ripple effect in the environment. Okay, true. Okay. So, going further, I would like to go into have an overview, rather, of some symptoms of heart diseases. And we see that symptoms can vary depending on the specific heart condition. But some common symptoms now could include chest pain, which is also known as angina, shortness of breath, fatigue or weakness, palpitations that's irregular or fast heartbeats, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea or indigestion. Do you have anything further to say about this? Okay, so, for the symptoms you just mentioned, it varies according to the heart condition. So, in some heart conditions, like congestive cardiac failure, you can see shortness of breath, also known as dyspnoea, where the individual finds it difficult to breathe in. And usually when there's the heart condition, it has an effect on the lungs and leads to pulmonary edema, where it obstructs and blocks the alveoli, so making breathing difficult. Also, the individual can notice fatigue or weakness and inability to do certain activities compared to before. Usually he will be able to run certain distances, but he will not be able to anymore. Those are also symptoms of cardiac diseases. Also, chest pain, like you mentioned, angina pectoris, where there's pain around the region of the chest can also be a presentation of cardiovascular diseases. Palpitations, which is irregular or fast heartbeats, can also present as heart, as cardiac conditions, you can have edema, which is what you know as swelling in the legs, where the person's leg, ankle, or feet can be swollen, it can be pitting or non-pitting edema. Also, nausea, vomiting, indigestion and dizziness, so to mention, but a few. These are some of the risks, and these are some of the symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Yeah. Alright. So, talking about risk factors for heart diseases, we see that they can be divided into modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Now, let's go into modifiable factors. We have high blood pressure, which is hypertension, high cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol consumption, stress and poor mental health, and a whole lot of others. And then going into non-modifiable, we see age, we see family, we see gender, we see ethnicity. So, do you have anything about modifiable risk factors? Okay, for the modifiable risk factors, these are risk factors that change can be, can be affected. Yes. So, these risk factors are not, are not genetic, they are not inbuilt, you can do something about them. So, for example, smoking. So, smoking poses a very, very high-risk cardiovascular diseases. An individual who smokes is at risk of different cardiovascular diseases, like atherosclerosis, that will eventually lead to hypertension, that will lead to congestive cardiac failure. So, obesity is another risk factor. An individual who is overweight beyond normal for his age and weight is going to tend towards having cardiovascular complications. So also, someone who has a sedentary lifestyle, who has less of physical activity, who usually doesn't do much, can also pose a risk for cardiovascular disease. Someone who does not exercise, someone who consumes unhealthy diets, that consumes a lot of fully unsaturated fats, is also at risk of cardiovascular diseases. Someone with high cholesterol levels, too much intake of alcohol and stress, to mention but a few. All of these are modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Okay, and how about the non-modifiable. Okay, for the non-modifiable risk factors. These risk factors, generally, these risk factors are in the individual and, for example, age. An individual who is older has a risk for more cardiovascular diseases because with age, the blood vessels become harder, there's thickening, there's fibrosis. This can predispose one to hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular disease. Also, a person who has a positive family history for a heart disease can also have a heart disease. For example, the father had myocardial infraction. He or she can also have myocardial infarction. For gender, usually men have a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases than female, and for some races, they are also predisposed to cardiovascular diseases. Alright, that's very, very true. So, let's talk about the prevention of heart diseases. So, we see that preventing heart disease now involves managing risk factors and making healthy lifestyle choices. So, talking about healthy diets, we see that person should consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats and should also limit intake of saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar. And we also see in the aspect of stress, managing stress. A person should practice relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga or deep breathing exercises. We also see regular health checks, checkups. Monitor your blood pressure consistently, cholesterol also and blood sugar levels regularly. Follow medical advice and take prescribed medications as directed. We also see avoid smoking and limit alcohol. Now, do you have anything to say about smoking? Like avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol? Okay. Yes. Yes. That is very, very, very important. That is very, very, very important. So, there's almost no benefit of smoking? Yes, smoking should be avoided, limit your alcohol intake, manage stress, go for regular health checkups to check your blood pressure and be sure that you are on track. And do make sure you stay hydrated, maintain a healthy body weight, get enough sleep, get enough rest as well. Yeah, that's true. Okay, so now i'll want to ask a question. So, what are some lifestyle changes that you have made to lower your risk of developing heart disease? Okay, so for lifestyle changes, things like exercise, exercising regularly and as often as possible. Yes. Also, good diets, healthy diets, reducing the level of junk and taking more fruits and vegetables can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Good rest, avoiding alcohol intake and smoking can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. All true. Thank you so much. Thank you.",my name is favor and i consents to recording this conversation my name is precious and i consents recording this conversation okay so we're looking at heart disease and by way of

and we see that symptoms can vary depending on the specific heart condition some common symptoms now could include chest pain which is also known as angina shortness of breath fatigue or weakness

nausea vomiting indigestion to mention what if you discuss some of the risk and this is some of the symptoms of cardiovascular disease talking about risk factors for heart disease we see that they can be divided into modifiable and non modifiable factors now let's go into multifami factors we have high blood pressure which is hypertension high cholesterol levels smoking diabetes overweight obesity physical inactivity unhealthy diet excessive alcohol consumption stress and poor mental health and a whole lot of others and then going into non modifiable we see age we see family we see gender see ethnicity so do you have anything about modifiable risk factors okay for the modifiable risk factors these are risk factors that change can be can be effected so these respects are not genetic they're not induced trying to do something about them so for example smoking so smoking poses a very very high risk disease an individual who smokes is at risk different cardiovascular disease like arteroscle

modifiable and how about the non modifiable okay for the non modifiable risk factors this risk factors generally this is factors in the individual for example age an individual who is older has because with age the blood vessels become harder this country schools want to have potential subsequent cardiovascular disease also a person who has a positive family history for a heart disease can

are not inbuilt you can do something about them so for example smoking so smoking poses a very very high risk cardiovascular diseases an individual who smokes is at risk of different cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis that will eventually lead to hypertension that will lead to congestive cardiac failure so obesity is another risk factor an individual who is overweight beyond normal for his age and weight is going to tend towards having cardiovascular complications so also someone who has a sedentary lifestyle who has less of physical activity who usually does not do much can also pose a risk for cardiovascular disease someone who does not exercise someone who consumes unhealthy diets that consumes a lot of fully unsaturated fats is also at risk of cardiovascular diseases someone with high cholesterol levels too much intake of alcohol and stress to mention but a few all of these are modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases okay and how about the non modifiable okay for the non modifiable risk factors these risk factors generally these risk factors are in the individual and for example age an individual who is older has a risk for more cardiovascular diseases because with age the blood vessels become harder there is thickening there is fibrosis this can predispose one to hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular disease also a person who has a positive family history for a heart disease can also have a heart disease for example the father had myocardial infraction he or she can also have myocardial infarction for gender usually men have a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases than female and for some races they are also predisposed to cardiovascular diseases alright that is very very true so let us talk about the prevention of heart diseases so we see that preventing heart disease now involves managing risk factors and making healthy lifestyle choices so talking about healthy diets we see that person should consume a diet rich in fruits vegetables whole grains lean proteins and healthy fats and should also limit intake of saturated fats trans fats cholesterol sodium and added sugar and we also see in the aspect of stress managing stress a person should practice relaxation techniques such as meditation yoga or deep breathing exercises we also see regular health checks checkups monitor your blood pressure consistently cholesterol also and blood sugar levels regularly follow medical advice and take prescribed medications as directed we also see avoid smoking and limit alcohol now do you have anything to say about smoking like avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol okay yes yes that is very very very important that is very very very important so there is almost no benefit of smoking yes smoking should be avoided limit your alcohol intake manage stress go for regular health checkups to check your blood pressure and be sure that you are on track and do make sure you stay hydrated maintain a healthy body weight get enough sleep get enough rest as well yeah that is true okay so now i will want to ask a question so what are some lifestyle changes that you have made to lower your risk of developing heart disease okay so for lifestyle changes things like exercise exercising regularly and as often as possible yes also good diets healthy diets reducing the level of junk and taking more fruits and vegetables can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases good rest avoiding alcohol intake and smoking can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases all true thank you so much thank you

My name is Abdulraman and I consent to recording this conversation. So in our society today, we have witnessed a rapid increase in the hike in oil prices, in price of oil around the world and in our country today. So what do you think has been the biggest factor? What do you think are the causes that's contributed to the increase in oil prices? I think the number one cause that increased the petrol price in Nigeria for a case study is the removal of subsidy by the new government. And also there have been some conflicts between the oil producing states that has actually affected the production of oil and oil bunkering and a lot of factors like the oil bunkering now, there are some communities in Niger Delta for example, for instance, where this oil has been extracted from and these communities are not receiving even like palliative from the government which has caused them to cause, to bring up a resistance group. The resistance group is not like the Ijaw people resistance group where these people go to oil pipes and break oil pipes, take oil illegally, sell it in black market. And a lot of atrocities have been done by these people due to the inability of the government to at least give them some stipends. Because you are taking oil from their, from their environment, from their communities and you are causing more environmental pollutions without being compensating them, which is causing a lot of effects on their children. The waters there are so, so bad. The health issue, the health care, everything just going wrong for them in that, in that community. So how do you expect them not to form a resistance group or not to try and fight for their right, even though they might be fighting in the wrong manner. But still they have justifications for some of their cries and their plea to the government. And these issues lead to increase in oil prices because they lead to shortage of oil and they have to make profit. So the price of petroleum increased and another cause of the hike in fuel prices, international conflict as well, like the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, has led to an increase in crude oil per barrel that led to a rapid increase in crude oil per barrel and this affects the oil price as well because now the barrel is being sold for a higher price. So after the crude has been refined, they have to sell the petroleum products and other byproducts of the crude at a higher price. So this also is another cause of the hike in oil prices. And it has a lot of impact on the economy. So visible impact, so obvious impacts on the economy. If, because many countries like country Nigeria now depends our main source of revenue is from oil. So if the price of oil goes up, you expect all other things to follow. Because we are mainly dependent on oil. Dependent on oil for transportation, depend on oil as well for industries. So if the price goes up, all other parts of the economy will grow up too. And this one of the major effects is that it leads to increase in price of goods and services of products. Because manufacturers use fuel for their machines in industry and they have to now they are buying it at a higher price. So it affects the price of what they produce as well. And in all aspects, both in agriculture, in transport industry, the rate of transportation also increase. And due to the effects of the hike in oil price. And if I may ask, what has been your personal experience that I have encountered with the rising oil price? That you have encountered. Rising oil price especially in my country, Nigeria has really caused a lot of issue in terms of food. Like you go to the market today, you buy a particular commodity for a particular price. Then the next day the price increase or triple save in some cases due to the increment, increase in oil price. Because even our oil are being sold when we transport them that we have been. We transport them using dollar. And whenever the dollar goes up automatically, the oil price also goes, will go up. Which will have other effects on the. Our goods and services that we buy. Even regular trans transport also became. We will become very, very expensive. This um. All these increments already has caused a lot of increment in poverty in our community. Because you can't. There is no increment in salaries and everything is increasing. So there is hike in every goods. So it would be impossible for people to buy, that are collecting minimal salary to also buy goods. And the effect it has an enormous effect on people in rate of, like you talk about poverty, people are unable to afford people are getting poorer and the minimum wage has not been increased. So it makes people not to be able to afford the things they can buy before because the old price has increased. And I think some solutions that can be. That can be preferred is one. If they can resolve the conflict in all these countries are cause the increase of crude go up. If there can be less wars among nations, it will greatly reduce the price of oil. And even within the country as well, If conflict and within communities where crude are being extracted from. If they can come into a peaceful resolution, I think it also affects the price and it will bring it down. And also corruption as well. There's a high rate of corruption in our country that has cause the fuel price to increase because people are stealing fuel, and those are in government are secretly stealing the fuel, making it short and making the price to go high. So if you can address all these issues, I believe that, the fuel, the price, the hike in price of fuel will greatly reduce. I need to have a good effects on the economy. Things will be balanced, and people will be able to afford the common things that they could afford before.",my name is victor and i consents to recording this conversation my name is abdraman and i consent to recording this conversation so in in our society is today we have witness a rapid increase in the hike in oil prices in price of um oil around the world i don't know in our country today so what do you think has been the biggest factor what do you think are the causes that's contributed to the increase in oil prices increase the petrol price in nigeria for for case study is the removal of subsidy by the new government and also there have been some conflict between the oil producing state that has actually affected the production of oil and oil bunches and a lot of factors in like oil bunker now there are some communities in niger delta for example for instance where this oil are being extracted from and these communities are not receiving even like party tip from the government which has cause them to cause and to bring go be resistant group um some the registering group is not like like the ijor people resistance group where these people go to oil pipes and break

war between ukraine and russia as led to an increase in crude oil a rapid increase in crude about and this affects us now the barriers being sold for a higher price the crude has been refined they have to sell the petroleum product another and by product at a higher price so does also is another cause of the hike in oil prices and it does a lot of impacts on the economy so obvious impacts on the economy because many countries like country niger depends main source of revenues from so if you price of u s base all of that seems to follow us mainly dependent on oil been on oil for transportation when on oil for industries so if you price goes part of the economy grow to and this one of the major effects is that this will increase of increase in price of goods and services of products because manufacturers use well for their machines in industry and they have to now they're buying it at a higher price so it affects the price of what they as well and in all aspects both in agriculture in transport industry the rate of transportation also increase and due to the effects of the hike in oil price and if i've been your personal experience die of encounter with the rising oil price die of encounter rising oil price especially in my country nigeria cause a lot of issue in terms of food like you go to the market today you buy a particular commodity for a particular price then the next day the price increase or cheap would save in some cases due to the increment increase in oil price because even our oil are being sold when we transport them them using dollar and whenever the dollar goes up automatically the oil price also goes will go up which effect on goods and services that we buy even regular transport also became become very very expensive this all these increment already has caused a lot of increment in poverty in our community because you can't and there's no salaries and everything is increasing so there's i think in every goods so it would be impossible for people to buy that quality minimal salary to also buy goods does it in the most effect on people you talk about forty people unable to afford its import minimum wage of increase so it makes people not to be able to afford it buy before because oil price have increase and i think some solutions that can't be i can't be preferred is one if they can resolve the conflict in all these countries ah cause increase of crude to go up if there can be less wars among nations it will greatly reduce the fu the price of whale and it won't within the country as well if conflict and within communities where crowd are being extracted from if they come come into a peaceful resolution i think it's also affects the price and it's a bring it down and also corruption as well it is a corruption in our country's fair price increases people are still in fail and those are in government security we can it's shots and making the price to go high so you can address all these issues i

Here with me is Morebise precious. And I also consent to the recording of this conversation. Yeah. Thank you. So our topic today is child marriage. And over the years, child marriage is a widespread social and human rights issue where individuals below the age of 18 are married, often without their consent. And this practice, it affects girls who are forced into marriage before their physical, mental and emotional maturity. So what do you know about child marriage in this part of the world? Okay. Generally, I believe child marriage should actually be termed a life threatener because I believe it stresses the life of children. It stresses their well being. There is a joy in expressing childhood, and I believe through child marriage that cannot be achieved. So it actually aborts the future of people. Yes, child children in particular. That's very true. So I read an article about child marriage in certain parts of the world still being a common practice even in the northern part of Nigeria. It's still a very common practice in northern part of Nigeria. What are your thoughts on this issue? I believe in the northern part of Nigeria, to be specific, although I would say that is not, the only part, that is the only tribe per se, that is only performing the act. But I believe that's where it is most common. And I think it's something that has been. That people have been. People of influence have been trying to curb. They have been trying to put an end to it. But this is something that has been ingrained deep in their culture and in their tribe, and I believe issue, and I believe it will take a long while for it to actually be. I don't even believe it can be completely eradicated. But I believe with education, health education, with acknowledging that, okay, these are the repercussions, these are the consequences. These are the even health related issues that can come from it, then I believe we should be able to work better on it. Oh, that's a very good point of view. So this child marriage affects people because it denies them of their chance to education, their health, and even development. How do you think child marriage can affect a young child, a young girl, for instance? Okay, the first thing is, I believe it's, let's talk about the body generally, or the feeling it's lower self esteem, because that is mostly gender inequality. If you are talking about child, you don't see a is, let's say a 15 boy, a 15 year old boy or a 14 year old boy getting married. They would definitely put him into work, maybe to learn work or to work on farms or something like that. But when it comes to female, you see 12, 13, 14 getting married already. So I believe that that is gender inequality and will lower children's self esteem. Then apart from that, there are practices that children shouldn't even be aware of yet, like sex. That is something. Child shouldn't have a full knowledge of what it entails. And I believe child marriage, we put the children at the forefront of experiencing and participating in sex, even against their consent. So. And I believe it's also robbed girls of their childhood and it threatens their well being. This is, there's something called. So this is a very prominent and a very prominent health issue that deals with child marriage, especially girls. And this is very prominent among girls of that experience. Child Yes, child marriage. So. And they become pregnant at some points. There are lots of pregnancy weeks that also comes in place because they are just so young, their body is not ready for it. So that is what I believe Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is true. And just like you said, it will lower their self esteem and expose. Expose them to harmful levels of domestic violence and abuse and also a violation of human rights, just like you said. It also takes a heavy toll on their mental health, because even people that are old and they are giving birth, they have post, there's something called postpartum after birth. So they experience postpartum depression, postpartum bipolar disorder, a lot of things like that. So imagine if a younger person is now experiencing all those at the same time with other health issues. I believe that could actually kill a child. So we can. We can just say child marriage is a killer of this thing. That is true. And generally, or should I say globally, efforts have been made to end child marriage and protect the rights of children to save an healthy childhood. So what do you think we can do as a country to prevent child marriage or protect the rights of these children? Okay. To reiterate what I already said in the previous conversation. So in the beginning of the conversation. So I will say they should, they really need to educate. Okay. I know it's not easy, because some people are so embedded in their culture, in their tradition and say I want to make my culture proud. I want to elevate my culture and things like that. So. But I believe with health education, with not only health education, with telling them the repercussions of this thing, with them saying it with their eyes, and not just keeping those children and stigmatizing them, bring them out. This is what has happened to this person. This is what has happened to this person. Let us learn from it. Let us desert from these things. So I believe it should also work and people should. I believe the law should also take a part in this. There should be a law side or there should be a law that. Okay. If there's anybody that is giving his or her child and in marriage and the child is less than 21, I believe there should be a court of law that goes against that or that punishes those offenders, just like how we have sex offenders. That is very true. That is very true. You said it all. Thank you very much. it was nice having this conversation with you Same her It was nice speaking with you on this Conversation.

consent to the recording of this conversation. here with me is morebise precious. and i also consent to the recording of this conversation. yeah. thank you. so our topic today is child marriage. and over the years, child marriage is a widespread social and human rights issue where individuals below the age of 18 are married, often without their consent. and this practice, it affects girls who are forced into marriage before their physical, mental and emotional maturity. so what do you know about child marriage in this part of the world? okay. generally, i believe child marriage should actually be termed a life threatener because i believe it stresses the life of children. it stresses their well being. there is a joy in expressing childhood, and i believe through child marriage that cannot be achieved. so it actually aborts the future of people. yes, child children in particular. that's very true. so i read an article about child marriage in certain parts of the world still being a common practice even in the northern part of nigeria. it's still a very common practice in northern part of nigeria. what are your thoughts on this issue? i believe in the northern part of nigeria, to be specific, although i would say that is not, the only part, that is the only tribe per se, that is only performing the act. but i believe that's where it is most common. and i think it's something that has been. that people have been. people of influence have been trying to curb. they have been trying to put an end to it. but this is something that has been ingrained deep in their culture and in their tribe, and i believe issue, and i believe it will take a long while for it to actually be. i don't even believe it can be completely eradicated. but i believe with education, health

My name is Peace Palm. And I consent to recording this conversation. So the topic is books. What's your favorite book? I don't think I have a favorite book because I like a lot of books. What is yours? My favorite book is I just like any book written by Colin Hoover and Karen Kingsbury and Francis Rivers. So why do you like their books? Because they have like their concepts. Book writing is very good. Okay, who is your favorite author? I think I like Sydney Sheldon. Okay. I know him. His books are very. How like put it. They are intriguing. Yes. He always has, like you can't expect. Yes. Suspense. There's always suspense. And he's my dad's favorite author too. And what book, like, what's your favorite book of his? Master of the game boy. It's very long. What is it about? Talk about. It's about. I don't know, it's about one guy, bar, that was like cheated in business. When he started, he was backstabbed. So for his like revenge, he now came back to, how I put it now to take vengeance on all those people, like to their generations, their grandchildren, all of them, he still came back to like revenge. What his would I say? What their great grandfather now did to him. Oh, that's nice. My favorite book of conning Hoover's is verity. And I like Verity because it's like out of her comfort zone kinda, because normally she writes about romance. And just like most of her books are, most of her books are predictable. But this one, it had a lot of like plot twists and a lot of. Even the endings. Yes. Like the middle was like. Ah. Then the ending just like made everything just go. Exactly. And um. What other book do you like? Um, there's this. Colleen Hoover's book. It was not all that shabbo, it still had all those. Plenty plot twists. I think the name is 13 minutes or so. Have you seen it? No. About one girl that drowned for like 30 minutes. Then she now. But they rescued her and then like she was still alive. One funny thing like that. Oh, I've never heard of it. I'm going to go and read it now. Um, have you read November 9? Yes. Wait. Yes, the one. I think November 9 is about fire. Is it now? I'm sorry, I used to confuse them because it's just similar. There's one about fire that she got burnt and then she had a scar and she was insecure about. That's what I'm saying. November 9. Now I think. I don't know. And then that was the date, right? That she got. Yeah. So, like, every anniversary of that day, I think she and her dad used to go for, like, lunch or dinner or something. I can't remember. The book is really. It's confusing. I can't really remember that. But you've read it ends with us. Yes, it ends with us. What do you think about what's his name? Is it Gavin? I can't remember their names. But the main guy sha. The one that. No, the one that had violence in him. And that's what me, I feel like. You feel like he's justified. No, he was just using it as an excuse. Yes, because every time, like, any time, it will happen that maybe he'll beat her or he'll do something. So he always had. He always had an excuse for it. Like that first time when it happened, he said he did not know what made him push her. How won't you know what will make you push somebody? Especially after the fact that, um. Is it his sister that told her that he killed somebody? He killed his brother when he was younger or something like that? Or is it him that told her that he killed his brother when he was younger? So he had that trauma. So I feel like maybe because he couldn't heal from that trauma. That's why it was always haunting him. And he's still paying me. That did not end up together. As toxic as it was. It was very toxic. I still felt like I wanted him to get that. But the line was crossed when he put. Pushed her down the stairs. Yes, that's it. And then was it the time? Was she pregnant twice? Or is it just one? No, I think it was just once. She gave birth now to. I was thinking maybe she had a miscarriage at first. Okay. No, I don't think so. So she was just pregnant once. And then when she. Now. I like the part that she. After she gave birth to the child, she now told him that this is over. And she now gave him that scenario of, if your daughter comes to tell you that somebody, her man, used to beat her and everything, would you tell her to stay with him? And then he said no. That's when he now realized. What nigerian author have you like? Which book? I don't think I can. Have you read them? Have you read that Legos book? What's it called? Nearly all the men in Lagos. Have you read it? Yes, I've read it. What's your thoughts? Men are mad. Men are crazy. I swear. Like that one that his wife was like the breadwinner of everything. That facebook. Yeah. And she was now feeling bad about it that her boss told her that she should come for, like, a vacation. And he was even angry. Why didn't she go? He's the one that was pushing her to, like, go, go. And then when she now went and nothing really. Okay, things happened, but, like, when she came back, things were never the same again. How will it be the same? But he was collecting the watch and. Everything, raping somebody else. He actually. Yes, he actually did. It was when she read. Because she kept on defending her husband. It was not when she read the girl's story and then she saw that particular line that hopefully her husband. That's when I knew that men are. Men are wicked. The one I read, sha. But it has all those. Yeah. LGBTQ things inside. I can't remember. No. Okay. I can't remember the name of the author. Body book is the death of Vivek og or something like that, sir. Okay. I've already read it. From nigerian book. Yes. It shocked me because me, I was thinking that, okay. The way it was going. Next thing I just saw that. I think he even kissed his cousin, baby. What? That's where he started. That book is crazy. Last Lasher, he died. They killed him because, like, his friends used to warn him that he. He's always kind of people that used to say, like, they want to come out as the real person that they are. What. What was. And I think there was, like, crisis in the. That they will be what? So one day he now went out during one of all those crisis. He wore his skirts. Lipstick, water, even. That's how they killed him. I'm not supposed to be laughing. Which one? Which one? Hmm. There's this one, I think I won't told ringtongue the name of the book. I can't remember. I don't have the screenshot again that the woman was married to one guy, but the guy has a disorder that he cannot see anybody's face. Like, if he looks at you, your face is just blurry. So it now, like the way they were writing the book, I forgot. The name of the book is Sha. Like, how they're writing the book is like a diary of somebody. I can't remember Sha. So the way they were writing the book, it was looking like it was the woman that was, like, expressing her feelings because they used to be so in love. But then their marriage just went south, so she now booked a trip. I mean, she won, like, all these. Will I say I don't know what it was she shouted. Won one thing, that they gave them a vacation to one place like that. So as they were going, the road was bad, it was raining heavily. When they reached the place, it now looked like all those haunted mansions or something like that. Then every day, Shas, they used to stay there. Weird things used to happen. And then there was, there were no houses around that place, except one particular cottage. Like that one small cottage. And it was one old weird woman that used to live there. So they didn't used to go and see her now. So apparently, after all this plenty drama, I think the some fish she now started seeing like, like ghosts appearing in the house or like somebody appearing maybe by the window or something. Now apparently the main person that was writing the book was that old woman that was in that house when that boy was young. You know, he can't see faces now. He only remembered that the woman that he was working with us, his mother, was wearing like a red gown. And then somebody in a car hit her and then she died. That was how he lost his mother. So he always remembers that his more a red gown, but he doesn't know who killed her. And like all those things now. So apparently the main person that was writing the book was his mother. No, not his mother. The woman that he originally married, that woman that he went for the vacation with, was the main person that killed his mom when he was younger. But he did not know. And then, like, I don't. The story is sha confusing, because that woman that was now in that cottage was not like his original wife, but that woman Shah made it in a way that she got married to him. And here and then she now displays down. So when that woman found out, she now made them to come close to her, and when she could now torture them and all those things. The book was creepy. I wish you remembered the name. So I really. Sounds interesting. I'll ask Ringtone. And then there's a book I read of, because Kingsbury and Francis Rivers, they are christian authors. So like, there's a book I read of. I'm not the one that writes hard songs. Abyss. No. Okay. No. Francis Rivers. No. He's redeeming love. Yeah. Redeeming. You're afraid. Yes. I've even watched the movie. I don't like it. I don't like any time that they make movies or books, because it never is. Yes. Meets the standard. Just. It's just like after. Yeah. When I read redeeming love. Redeeming love was like the first ever book I read of fancy rivers and the book is big. It was long, but it was interesting because I think they were talking about Hosea by the Bible, but it made it sound very interesting and very so. In the Bible. But like, it just made it sound like human, like. Yes. And it was like real. Yes, exactly. How you marry somebody and then she'll go back. After you've taken out of prostitution, she will now go back. Even sleep with your brother. Yeah, well, it was his brother, but. Then he just went back because he said, God said that. Well, if it was me, I don't think I got. And the fact that he went like, he met her at first in like. Like, as he's just so high. It was just like love at first sight. And then he will paid for her time. Like, he paid, like he paid for her time. Right? I can't remember. I read the book a long time ago. Anyways, he kept on paying to see her and he was not doing anything with that. Yes, he'll just sit down and just talk and just see. He just wants to talk. And then another book I read. But there's a book that. It has like two series, like two parts. The first one is matters legacy. And then her mother's legacy, you see. Then her daughters, fancy rivers still. And then the book was talking about, um, just know, like three descendants. The first one, like everything, it was like a cause following each other. Because like, what happens to the first one happens to the second. Like they were all going through the same thing they were going through the first time she was raped. And then her daughter now got raped too, when it was like it was just repeating itself. And then they never had, like, good relationship with their mothers. Like three of them never have good relationship. Very confusing. And then I used to forget some. Books, even me too, most times. Like, if I don't talk about it immediately, I finish reading it after. Sometimes be so, like, this is just blurry. I can't remember some parts, but, like, I can't. What else? What other book? There's one again that I read recently. What's the name? I can't remember the name. Boys. All those creepy books. Basically at the end of it is just showing you, like, how the devil used to, like, say, trick people into believing that he's a good person. Okay, I'm trying to remember the name. Shall I read it last semester? Not read any book recently? I remember the last book I read. Yes, let's talk about. Because they don't see novels, books, constitutional law or something. I don't think I'm busting that. So what books? What books? What's your favorite book related to law? Criminal law. I think I like it because the. It has a lot of scenario. All the cases are like stories basically. So you can always remember the scene. Can you remember that case in the criminal law book that in the criminal law book that he used cutlass to and he said that it was a snake or something. It was his mom that he used. Okay. Yes. That the place was dimly dark and everything when he now he even cut her and body part safely and he. Now claimed that it was a snake. And the fact that he could just like Lol. And then what other story in the. Law books can you remember that one that he went to go and he was married then he now brought one woman to his house. I think he's concubine Abi. What? That he even told his wife to cook for them. Then she now went to kill the woman in the night when she was sleeping. Can you remember that one? That one? I think it cause criminal law book too. That one? That one. That he brought his friends and each of his friends had their moments with her and then. And then he was not even charged with anything because he was married to her. Exactly. It's not fair that case. It hurts my feelings.",my name is more and i consent to record in this conversation my name is peace palm and i consent to recording this conversation so the topic is books what was your favorite book

adejumo and i consent to recording this conversation. my name is peace palm. and i consent to recording this conversation. so the topic is books. what's your favorite book? i don't think i have a favorite book because i like a lot of books. what is yours? my favorite book is i just like any book written by colin hoover and karen kingsbury and francis rivers. so why do you like their books? because they have like their concepts. book writing is very good. okay, who is your favorite author? i think i like sydney sheldon. okay. i know him. his books are very. how like put it. they are intriguing. yes. he always has, like you can't expect. yes. suspense. there's always suspense. and he's my dad's favorite author too. and what book, like, what's your favorite book of his? master of the game boy. it's very long. what is it about? talk about. it's about. i don't know, it's about one guy, bar, that was like cheated in business. when he started, he was backstabbed. so for his like revenge, he now came back to, how i put it now to take vengeance on all those people, like to their generations, their grandchildren, all of them, he still came back to like revenge. what his would i say? what their great grandfather now did to him. oh, that's nice. my favorite book of conning hoover's is verity. and i like verity because it's like out of her comfort zone kinda, because normally she writes about romance. and just like most of her books are, most of her books are predictable. but this one, it had a lot of like plot twists and a lot of. even the endings. yes. like the middle was like. ah. then the ending just like made everything just go. exactly. and what other book do you like? um, there's this. colleen hoover's book. it was not all that shabbo, it still had all those. plenty plot twists. i think the name is 13 minutes or so. have you seen it? no. about one girl that drowned for like 30 minutes. then she now. but they rescued her and then like she was still alive. one funny thing like that. oh, i've never heard of it. i'm going to go and read it now. um, have you read november 9? yes. wait. yes, the one. i think november 9 is about fire. is it now? i'm sorry, i used to confuse them because it's just similar. there's one about fire that she got burnt and then she had a scar and she was insecure about. that's what i'm saying. november 9. now i think. i don't know. and then that was the date, right? that she got. yeah. so, like, every anniversary of that day, i think she and her dad used to go for, like, lunch or dinner or something. i can't remember. the book is really. it's confusing. i can't really remember that. but you've read it ends with us. yes, it ends with us. what do you think about what's his name? is it gavin? i can't remember their names. but the main guy sha. the one that. no, the one that had violence in him. and that's what me, i feel like. you feel like he's justified. no, he was just using it as an excuse. yes, because every time, like, any time, it will happen that maybe he'll beat her or he'll do something. so he always had. he always had an excuse for it. like that first time when it happened, he said he did not know what made him push her. how won't you know what will make you push somebody? especially after the fact that, is it his sister that told her that he killed somebody? he killed his brother when he was younger or something like that? or is it him that told her that he killed his brother when he was younger? so he had that trauma. so i feel like maybe because he couldn't heal from that trauma. that's why it was always haunting him. and he's still paying me. that did not end up together. as toxic as it was. it was very toxic. i still felt like i wanted him to get that. but the line was crossed when he put. pushed her down the stairs. yes, that's it. and then was it the time? was she pregnant twice? or is it just one? no, i think it was just once. she gave birth now to. i was thinking maybe she had a miscarriage at first. okay. no, i don't think so. so she was just pregnant once. and then when she. now. i like the part that she. after she gave birth to the child, she now told him that this is over. and she now gave him that scenario of, if your daughter comes to tell you that somebody, her man, used to beat her and everything, would you tell her to stay with him? and then he said no. that's when he now realized. what nigerian author have you like? which book? i don't think i can. have you read them? have you read that legos book? what's it called? nearly all the men in lagos. have you read it? yes, i've read it. what's your thoughts? men are mad. men are crazy. i swear. like that one that his wife was like the breadwinner of everything. that facebook. yeah. and she was now feeling bad about it that her boss told her that she should come for, like, a vacation. and he was even angry. why didn't she go? he's the one that was pushing her to, like, go, go. and then when she now went and nothing really. okay, things happened, but, like, when she came back, things were never the same again. how will it be the same? but he was collecting the watch and. everything, raping somebody else. he actually. yes, he actually did. it was when she read. because she kept on defending her husband. it was not when she read the girl's story and then she saw that particular line that hopefully her husband. that's when i knew that men are. men are wicked. the one i read, sha. but it has all those. yeah. lgbtq things inside. i can't remember. no. okay. i can't remember the name of the author. body book is the death of vivek og or something like that, sir. okay. i've already read it. from nigerian book. yes. it shocked me because me, i was thinking that, okay. the way it was going. next thing i just saw that. i think he even kissed his cousin, baby. what? that's where he started. that book is crazy. last lasher, he died. they killed him because, like, his friends used to warn him that he. he's always kind of people that used to say, like, they want to come out as the real person that they are. what. what was. and i think there was, like, crisis in the. that they will be what? so one day he now went out during one of all those crisis. he wore his skirts. lipstick, water, even. that's how they killed him. i'm not supposed to be laughing. which one? which one? hmm. there's this one, i think i won't told ringtongue the name of the book. i can't remember. i don't have the screenshot again that the woman was married to one guy, but the guy has a disorder that he cannot see anybody's face. like, if he looks at you, your face is just blurry. so it now, like the way they were writing the book, i forgot. the name of the book is sha. like, how they're writing the book is like a diary of somebody. i can't remember sha. so the way they were writing the book, it was looking like it was the woman that was, like, expressing her feelings because they used to be so in love. but then their marriage just went south, so she now booked a trip. i mean, she won, like, all these. will i say i don't know what it was she shouted. won one thing, that they gave them a vacation to one place like that. so as they were going, the road was bad, it was raining heavily. when they reached the place, it now looked like all those haunted mansions or something like that. then every day, shas, they used to stay there. weird things used to happen. and then there was, there were no houses around that place, except one particular cottage. like that one small cottage. and it was one old weird woman that used to live there. so they didn't used to go and see her now. so apparently, after all this plenty drama, i think the some fish she now started seeing like, like ghosts appearing in the house or like somebody appearing maybe by the window or something. now apparently the main person that was writing the book was that old woman that was in that house when that boy was young. you know, he can't see faces now. he only remembered that the woman that he was working with us, his mother, was wearing like a red gown. and then somebody in a car hit her and then she died. that was how he lost his mother. so he always remembers that his more a red gown, but he doesn't know who killed her. and like all those things now. so apparently the main person that was writing the book was his mother. no, not his mother. the woman that he originally married, that woman that he went for the vacation with, was the main person that killed his mom when he was younger. but he did not know. and then, like, i don't. the story is sha confusing, because that woman that was now in that cottage was not like his original wife, but that woman shah made it in a way that she got married to him. and here and then she now displays down. so when that woman found out, she now made them to come close to her, and when she could now torture them and all those things. the book was creepy. i wish you remembered the name. so i really. sounds interesting. i'll ask ringtone. and then there's a book i read of, because kingsbury and francis rivers, they are christian authors. so like, there's a book i read of. i'm not the one that writes hard songs. abyss. no. okay. no. francis rivers. no. he's redeeming love. yeah. redeeming. you're afraid. yes. i've even watched the movie. i don't like it. i don't like any time that they make movies or books, because it never is. yes. meets the standard. just. it's just like after. yeah. when i read redeeming love. redeeming love was like the first ever book i read of fancy rivers and the book is big. it was long, but it was interesting because i think they were talking about hosea by the bible, but it made it sound very interesting and very so. in the bible. but like, it just made it sound like human, like. yes. and it was like real. yes, exactly. how you marry somebody and then she'll go back. after you've taken out of prostitution, she will now go back. even sleep with your brother. yeah, well, it was his brother, but. then he just went back because he said, god said that. well, if it was me, i don't think i got. and the fact that he went like, he met her at first in like. like, as he's just so high. it was just like love at first sight. and then he will paid for her time. like, he paid, like he paid for her time. right? i can't remember. i read the book a long time ago. anyways, he kept on paying to see her and he was not doing anything with that. yes, he'll just sit down and just talk and just see. he just wants to talk. and then another book i read. but there's a book that. it has like two series, like two parts. the first one is matters legacy. and then her mother's legacy, you see. then her daughters, fancy rivers still. and then the book was talking about, um, just know, like three descendants. the first one, like everything, it was like a cause following each other. because like, what happens to the first one happens to the second. like they were all going through the same thing they were going through the first time she was raped. and then her daughter now got raped too, when it was like it was just repeating itself. and then they never had, like, good relationship with their mothers. like three of them never have good relationship. very confusing. and then i used to forget some. books, even me too, most times. like, if i don't talk about it immediately, i finish reading it after. sometimes be so, like, this is just blurry. i can't remember some parts, but, like, i can't. what else? what other book? there's one again that i read recently. what's the name? i can't remember the name. boys. all those creepy books. basically at the end of it is just showing you, like, how the devil used to, like, say, trick people into believing that he's a good person. okay, i'm trying to remember the name. shall i read it last semester? not read any book recently? i remember the last book i read. yes, let's talk about. because they don't see novels, books, constitutional law or something. i don't think i'm busting that. so what books? what books? what's your favorite book related to law? criminal law. i think i like it because the. it has a lot of scenario. all the cases are like stories basically. so you can always remember the scene. can you remember that case in the criminal law book that in the criminal law book that he used cutlass to and he said that it was a snake or something. it was his mom that he used. okay. yes. that the place was dimly dark and everything when he now he even cut her and body part safely and he. now claimed that it was a snake. and the fact that he could just like lol. and then what other story in the. law books can you remember that one that he went to go and he was married then he now brought one woman to his house. i think he's concubine abi. what? that he even told his wife to cook for them. then she now went to kill the woman in the night when she was sleeping. can you remember that one? that one? i think it cause criminal law book too. that one? that one. that he brought his friends and each of his friends had their moments with her and then. and then he was not even charged with anything because he was married to her. exactly. it's not fair that case. it hurts my feelings.",0.4960998439937597,my name is more and i consent to record in this conversation my name is peace palm and i consent to recording this conversation so the topic is books what was your

originally married that woman that he went for the vacation with was the main person that killed his mom when he was younger but he did not know and then like i do not this story confusing because that woman that was now in that cottage was now like his original wife or that woman she made it in a way that she got married to him and then she now displays down so when that woman found out she

vengeance on all those people like to their generations their grandchildren all of them he still came back to like revenge what his would i say what their great grandfather now did to him 0 that is nice my favorite book of conning hoover is is verity and i like verity because it is like out of her comfort zone kinda because normally she writes about romance and just like most of her books are most of her books are predictable but this one it had a lot of like plot twists and a lot of even the endings yes like the middle was like ah then the ending just like made everything just go exactly and what other book do you like there is this colleen hoover is book it was not all that shabbo it still had all those plenty plot twists i think the name is 13 minutes or so have you seen it no about one girl that drowned for like 30 minutes then she now but they rescued her and then like she was still alive one funny thing like that 0 i have never heard of it i am going to go and read it now have you read november 9 yes wait yes the one i think november 9 is about fire is it now i am sorry i used to confuse them because it is just similar there is one about fire that she got burnt and then she

what do you think about what is his name is it gavin i can not remember their names but the main guy sha the one that no the one that had violence in him and that is what me i feel like you feel like he is justified no he was just using it as an excuse yes because every time like any time it will happen that maybe he will beat her or he will do something so he always had he always had an excuse for it like that 1st time when it happened he said he did not know what made him push her how will not you know what will make you push somebody especially after the fact that is it his sister that told her that he killed somebody he killed his brother when he was younger or something like that or is it him that told her that he killed his brother when he was younger so he had that trauma so i feel like maybe because he could not heal from that trauma that is why it was always haunting him and he is still paying me that did not end up together as toxic as it was it was very toxic i still felt like i wanted him to get that but the line was crossed when he put pushed her down the stairs yes that is it and then was it the time was she pregnant twice or is it just one no i think it was just once she gave birth now to i was thinking maybe she had a miscarriage at 1st okay no i do not think so so she was just pregnant once and then when she now i like the part that she after she gave birth to the child she now told him that this is over and she now gave him that scenario of if your daughter comes to tell you that somebody her man used to beat her and everything would you tell her to stay with him and then he said no that is when he now realized what nigerian author have you like which book i do not think i can have you read them have you read that legos book what is it called nearly all the men in lagos have you read it yes i have read it what is your thoughts men are mad men are crazy i swear like that one that his wife was like the breadwinner of everything that facebook yeah and she was now feeling bad about it that her boss told her that she should come for like a vacation and he was even angry why did not she go he is the one that was pushing her to like go go and then when she now went and nothing really okay things happened but like when she came back things were never the same again how will it be the same but he was collecting the watch and everything raping somebody else he actually yes he actually did it was when she read because she kept on defending her husband it was not when she read the girl is story and then she saw that particular line that hopefully her husband that is when i knew that men are men are wicked the one i read sha but it has all those yeah lgbtq things inside i can not remember no okay i can not remember the name of the author body book is the death of vivek og or something like that sir okay i have already read it from nigerian book yes it shocked me because me i was thinking that okay the way it was going next

My name is Wang Cholom and I consent to this recording. Yeah. So, rape, big topic for our society. Big, big topic. So what's your point of view about rape? I see rape as a very bad and heinous crime. I see it as something that sets the society ablaze to me. Okay. If anyone hears of an, of a case of rape or is accused of rape, the person is viewed as a very bad person and is already judged by society before being judged in court or any other place. Okay? Yes. And it's a bad crime such that some people take matters into their hands. You can take the life of people accused of. It's a very bad and societal threatening crime. Okay. Personally, my opinion about rape is rape rape, as you said is so bad because it does so much trauma, especially to the victims, not just sexually, but psychologically. Most people, be it male or female, you know, they come out with cases of PTSD. Even after years of therapy, you know, they are still having that post traumatic like syndrome kind of stuff. So I see rape as very, very bad. But on your own, on your own, your own view, personally, do you think society is favoring rape in the sense of dress manner, in the sense of parental instructions, in the sense of religious bodies? Do you think we are favoring it or the things they are doing at those particular fronts are reducing the incidence of rape? I don't think what we're doing presently as a society, community and individually is bringing down or stepping down the issue of rape. I feel like it's increasing it and boosting it. Societies begin to accept dress codes that are so seductive and it permits all kind of things, like people can go out however they choose to walk around the streets and then if someone, you'll expect that other people will have self-control, and I don't think it's right. I don't think it's, I don't think society is trying because society is actually promoting this thing and they are calling it fashion. Fashion show. Yeah. Because like, let me give you an example. I saw a piece of, let me just say like waistband strap of a jeans that is being sold as a full clothing. So, you see, and girls these days, they just. They go for that. They just go around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Opening their backs up and not knowing or thinking that, okay, this might arouse. Yeah. Someone's interest. Sure. So, society isn't helping, not one bit. And it has gone from not being there to bad to worse. Yeah. And I don't know what's next to. Be worst, I guess. Yes. And the generation, present generation, coming in has the trend of doing it and still, when maybe someone takes a look at them, they harass you. Like, have you never seen someone dress before? The community supports them. But when such a person is said to be raped? No, they don't look like, okay, this person has been indecently dressed for a while. They just go ahead and say, why did this person do it? Yeah. Without thinking that probably that person has been pushed. And you never know. Most rape cases are not cases that just happen. Maybe outside, maybe you get to hear that the person paid an opposite sex a visit, and people don't end up asking what actually happened. So, society doesn't help at all. Yeah, talking about society, I had this, in my experience, where I think I was around the junction, and I saw. I saw a lady, and an elderly woman was trying to, like, you know, correct her and dress good. And it was in an appropriate manner. You know, the manner of correction also matters. There are people that can just see, I'm like, You know, stuff like that. But she was correcting this lady a lovely manner, in a motherly manner. And just for the lady to, you know, speak very bad at this woman, telling her all sort of stuff like, it's my body, you didn't buy the clothes for me. You know, stuff like that. So, if this person, for instance, now falls victim of rape, and it's within the neighboring community, and that woman, per venture, is in the presence of the crime scene, she has no say. Because when I was giving you that advice, you were, you were adamant about your own point of view on the way you were dressed. So, it's a big thing. I think it needs to be corrected from the home front. As the saying goes, charity begins from home. Once parents can tell their children, this is it, this is that. There's no doubt about it that the minds of some people are perverted. Whether you wear a big clothes or you cover everywhere, there are just still some people that will look at you and feel sexually aroused by your outfit. But at least something should be done on the home front or in the home front, rather, to see that we put ethics, especially dressing, dressing ethics. Yeah, put dressing ethics. Inculcate it in the minds of young people. And, you know, I feel like it will go a long way to reduce rape cases or rape incidents in the society. And secondly, I don't know, what's your point of view concerning the media, be it social media, the media. It's actually worse than the physical society, social media doesn't help at all. Like, for social media, I would say it's very terrible, extremely terrible. You go online, you try to click on a site, and you get to notice that a lot of pop ups that pop up these days are sexual pop ups, almost on every site, even clean sites you want to go in. Maybe you want to download something simple, video for work or something. They keep popping ads for you. Apart from that, you go online, especially for the youth of this age. Yeah. The so-called Gen Z. It means that their parents can't control what the view online. You go to virtually any site, you go to their own social media. Good. Even cartoons. Yeah. For the younger generations. Yeah. Something else. Yeah. I once saw a cartoon, well, my friend, she once watched, started watching a cartoon. Actually, it's her kids thinking it was a cartoon. I don't know if I'm permitted to name the name of the cartoon. Sure, you are. Yeah, but, okay, like cartoon, like sausage party or American dad, they're all sexually induced, like. So social media doesn't help you. They go online, they can watch all these things. As a parent, you might say, okay, don't watch those programs, don't watch that one. But they go online. They can download it. They can download Netflix on their phone, watch these things. They can go on WhatsApp and share pictures with each other. Sure. They can go on Facebook and watch porn for free. Go on Twitter and see the same thing. And some sites might be like, yeah. Hope you're 18 and even if you're not 18. Yeah. Just click and yes, sure. And nothing happens because there's no means for proper verification. Sure, sure. There's no luck and there's no prevention because these sites too, like all over the site, pay for rights for ads and all that. So, the online community, to me, is what start it. Yeah. So social media is a kind of negative role. An extremely negative. Kids don't go online anymore to study. Sure. Once they study and they just divert to go and look for one or two more interesting things, and they end up getting distracted with all these things from the net. Yeah. Tomorrow you see them voting and shouting for role models that are not actually role models. Role models, sure. People that dress, indecently. That I just feel like if we were to compare, like, the incidents of rape way before and now I think it's on the rising. Do you agree with that? Yeah, I agree with that. I actually do agree with that. And for me personally, I think it's because of the advent of social media, because of the advent of, you know, exposure, exposure. People we don't call, we don't cope. We don't cope. The screen, there's this thing DStv started doing, I think some years back that there is parental guide, you can lock some certain channels, you know, for your kids not to have access. And I think it's one way that we can use social media and still use it effectively, effectively, rather to curb all these screen exposures and stuff like that. So have you had anyone like directly been a victim of it or have you been a victim of rape? No. Because men are also abused. Yeah, men are also abused. I believe that men don't even come out to say it because, because they feel like they are manly. They come out to say it. It's a shameful thing in society. It's a shameful thing in the society. A lot of men just keep it to themselves and end up with it, trying to be manly and all that. But men to are victims of rape. Yeah, yeah. I had a friend back in the university and he told me he had an aunt that raped him as early as age, was he age ten or twelve? And, you know, each time he's going through a phase in life, he just thinks about that and kind of affects his mental health. So, these are some of the issues that rape does to someone or to a person. So, I just feel like society should put more measures, especially on social media and the family front. Let parents be intentional about what their kids watch. Let parents be intentional about the friends their kids keep, because peer pressure is something that affects people that are growing up. And one thing again, is. They should also, be intentional about what their kids wear. Wear, exactly. Their kids, everything. Especially young girls. Yeah, sure, sure. And to the younger girls also, and the guys, young guys, young girls, there should be sensation about. Yeah, we know you're just getting to your prime, but life just begins here. And for you to be at the end of exposure and exposing dresses, it only makes your life that is just beginning to end at that point because you could, you could be a victim of rape. You know, there are many things, STD's, what have you, that you could have, through rape, and stuff like that. So there should be more orientation. There should be more orientation on detrimental issues of it, and I think the society will get better bit by bit if we do that.",my name is i consent to this recording my name is juan tolo and i consent to this record yeah so rip big topic for society big big topic so what was your point of view about rip very bad and hinious crying i see something that sets the society to me if anyone hears of a case of rape or is accused of rape person very bad person is already judged by society before being judged in court or in your place it's bad crime such that people into their hands people sure very bad and societal quite personally my opinion reprieve as you say this guy is so bad because it does so much trauma especially victims not just sexuality or psychological most people be male or female you know they come out with cases of p t s d even after years of therapy you know they're still having post traumatic kind of stuff so i see it boats on your own and your own your own view personally do you think society's fever in rip in the sense of dress manner in descends of of parental instructions in the sense of religious bodies you think we're favoring it or the things they are doing those particular fronts reducing the incidence of i don't think presently community individually is bringing down or stepping down the issue of i feel like it's increasing it is beginning to

society is actually promoting these thing and fashion first i'm sure because let me give you an example i saw a piece of let me just see like we strap of jeans that is being sold as a full clothing so you see and girls these sure sure opening their bags and not knowing or think that okay these might arouse someone's interest sure society isn't sure to be and it has gone from not being there to bad to war towards and i don't know what's next to the worst generation present generation coming of doing it and still when maybe someone takes a look harass you have you never seen someone dressed

person you never know most trick cases a lot of cases that just happen maybe outside you get to hear that a person peed up seeing what actually happened what talking about society this think junction and i saw i saw a lady and an elderly woman was trying to you know correct dress good i was it was inappropriate manner you know demand of correction also matters there are people that kind you know stuff like that but um she was correcting this lady in lovely manner in a motherly manner and just for the lady to you know speak very bad at this woman telling her all sort of stuff like it's my body you didn't buy clothes for me you know stuff like that so if this person for instance now falls victim of rape and is within the neighboring community and a woman per venture is in the presence of the

indicate nothing happens because there's no means for proper verification sure sure there's no lock and there's no prevention because these sites too like all over that site pay for rights for ads and all that the online community to me is worse than yeah so social media negative rule and extremely negative kids don't go online anymore to study sure and they just divert look for one or two more

because you could could be victim of rape you know their main things as did war you could have to reap and stuff like that so there should be more orientation more on detrimental issues of rape and i think this was a to get better bits by bit if we do that,"my name is emmanuel oswa and i consent to this recording. my name is wang cholom and i consent to this recording. yeah. so, rape, big topic for our society. big, big topic. so what's your point of view about rape? i see rape as a very bad and heinous crime. i see it as something that sets the society ablaze to me. okay. if anyone hears of an, of a case of rape or is accused of rape, the person is viewed as a very bad person and is already judged by society before being judged in court or any other place. okay? yes. and it's a bad crime such that some people take matters into their hands. you can take the life of people accused of. it's a very bad and societal threatening crime. okay. personally, my opinion about rape is rape rape, as you said is so bad because it does so much trauma, especially to the victims, not just sexually, but psychologically. most people, be it male or female, you know, they come out with cases of ptsd. even after years of therapy, you know, they are still having that post traumatic like syndrome kind of stuff. so i see rape as very, very bad. but on your own, on your own, your own view, personally, do you think society is favoring rape in the sense of dress manner, in the sense of parental instructions, in the sense of religious bodies? do you think we are favoring it or the things they are doing at those particular fronts are reducing the incidence of rape? i don't think what we're doing presently as a society, community and individually is bringing down or stepping down the issue of rape. i feel like it's increasing it and boosting it. societies begin to accept dress codes that are so seductive and it permits all kind of things, like people can go out however they choose to walk around the streets and then if someone, you'll expect that other people will have self-control, and i don't think it's right. i don't think it's, i don't think society is trying because society is actually promoting this thing and they are calling it fashion. fashion show. yeah. because like, let me give you an example. i saw a piece of, let me just say like waistband strap of a jeans that is being sold as a full clothing. so, you see, and girls these days, they just. they go for that. they just go around. yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. opening their backs up and not knowing or thinking that, okay, this might arouse. yeah. someone's interest. sure. so, society isn't helping, not one bit. and it has gone from not being there to bad to worse. yeah. and i don't know what's next to. be worst, i guess. yes. and the generation, present generation, coming in has the trend of doing it and still, when maybe someone takes a look at them, they harass you. like, have you never seen someone dress before? the community supports them. but when such a person is said to be raped? no, they don't look like, okay, this person has been indecently dressed for a while. they just go ahead and say, why did this person do it? yeah. without thinking that probably that person has been pushed. and you never know. most rape cases are not cases that just happen. maybe outside, maybe you get to hear that the person paid an opposite sex a visit, and people don't end up asking what actually happened. so, society doesn't help at all. yeah, talking about society, i had this, in my experience, where i think i was around the junction, and i saw. i saw a lady, and an elderly woman was trying to, like, you know, correct her and dress good. and it was in an appropriate manner. you know, the manner of correction also matters. there are people that can just see, i'm like, you know, stuff like that. but she was correcting this lady a lovely manner, in a motherly manner. and just for the lady to, you know, speak very bad at this woman, telling her all sort of stuff like, it's my body, you didn't buy the clothes for me. you know, stuff like that. so, if this person, for instance, now falls victim of rape, and it's within the neighboring community, and that woman, per venture, is in the presence of the crime scene, she has no say. because when i was giving you that advice, you were, you were adamant about your own point of view on the way you were dressed. so, it's a big thing. i think it needs to be corrected from the home front. as the saying goes, charity begins from home. once parents can tell their children, this is it, this is that. there's no doubt about it that the minds of some people are perverted. whether you wear a big clothes or you cover everywhere, there are just still some people that will look at you and feel sexually aroused by your outfit. but at least something should be done on the home front or in the home front, rather, to see that we put ethics, especially dressing, dressing ethics. yeah, put dressing ethics. inculcate it in the minds of young people. and, you know, i feel like it will go a long way to reduce rape cases or rape incidents in the society. and secondly, i don't know, what's your point of view concerning the media, be it social media, the media. it's actually worse than the physical society, social media doesn't help at all. like, for

co we do not call the screen just being disturbed doing some years but this parental gade you can look some certain channels you know for your not to have access and i think it is one we can use social media and still use effective effectively to cope all these screen exposures and stuff like that has you heard anyone like or have you been a victim because men also used the men doing come out to see because if you like men just keep it to themselves and end up trying to be manly and all that but men towards victims of yeah i i had a friend back in university and he told me he had an aunt that raped him as early as age was he age 10 or 12 and you know each time he is going through a phase in life he just thinks about and it can all affect his mental health so these are some of the issues that rip rip does to someone or to a person so i just feel like society should put more measures especially on social media and family friends their parents be intentional about kids watch be intentional friends keep because peer pressure is something that affects people that are going up and one thing is exactly yeah sure sure sure and to the younger girls also and the guys young guys young girls there should be sensation about here we know you just get into your prayer boats life just begins here and for you to be the end of exposure and exposing jesus it makes your life that is just beginning to end at that point because you could could be victim of rape you know their main things as did war you could have to reap and stuff like that so there should be more orientation more on detrimental issues of rape and i think this was a to get better bits by bit if we do that,my name is emmanuel oswa and i consent to this recording my name is wang cholom and i consent to this recording yeah so rape big topic for our society big big topic so what is your point of view about rape i see rape as a very bad and heinous crime i see it as something that sets the society ablaze to me okay if anyone hears of an of a case of rape or is accused of rape the person is viewed as a very bad person and is already judged by society before being judged in court or any other place okay yes and it is a bad crime such that some people take matters into their hands you can take the life of people accused of it is a very bad and societal threatening crime okay personally my opinion about rape is rape rape as you said is so bad because it does so much trauma especially to the victims not just sexually but psychologically most people be it male or female you know they come out with cases of ptsd even after years of therapy you know they are still having that post traumatic like syndrome kind of stuff so i see rape as very very bad but on your own on your own your own view personally do you think society is favoring rape in the sense of dress manner in the sense of parental instructions in the sense of religious bodies do you think we are favoring it or the things they are doing at those particular fronts are reducing the incidence of rape i do not think what we are doing presently as a society community and individually is bringing down or stepping down the issue of rape i feel like it is increasing it and boosting it societies begin to accept dress codes that are so seductive and it permits all kind of things like people can go out however they choose to walk around the streets and then if someone you will expect that other people will have self control and i do not think it is right i do not think it is i do not think society is trying because society is actually promoting this thing and they are calling it fashion fashion show yeah because like let me give you an example i saw a piece of let me just say like waistband strap of a jeans that is being sold as a full clothing so you see and girls these days they just they go for that they just go around yeah yeah yeah sure opening their backs up and not knowing or thinking that okay this might arouse yeah someone is interest sure so society is not helping not one bit and it has gone from not being there to bad to worse yeah and i do not know what is next to be worst i guess yes and the generation present generation coming in has the trend of doing it and still when maybe someone takes a look at them they harass you like have you never seen someone dress before the community supports them but when such a person is said to be raped no they do not look like okay this person has been indecently dressed for a while they just go ahead and say why did this person do it yeah without thinking that probably that person has been pushed and you never know most rape cases are not cases that just happen maybe outside maybe you get to hear that the person paid an opposite sex a visit and people do not end up asking what actually happened so society does not help at all yeah talking about society i had this in my experience where i think i was around the junction and i saw i saw a lady and an elderly woman was trying to like you know correct her and dress good and it was in an appropriate manner you know the manner of correction also matters there are people that can just see i am like you know stuff like that but she was correcting this lady a lovely manner in a motherly manner and just for the lady to you know speak very bad at this woman telling her all sort of stuff like it is my body you did not buy the clothes for me you know stuff like that so if this person for instance now falls victim of rape and it is within the neighboring community and that woman per venture is in the presence of the crime scene she has no say because when i was giving you that advice you were you were adamant about your own point of view on the way you were dressed so it is a big thing i think it needs to be corrected from the home front as the saying goes charity begins from home once parents can tell their children this is it this is that there is no doubt about it that the minds of some people are perverted whether you wear a big clothes or you cover everywhere there are just still some people that will look at you and feel sexually aroused by your outfit but at least something should be done on the home front or in the home front rather to see that we put ethics especially dressing dressing ethics yeah put dressing ethics inculcate it in the minds of young people and you know i feel like it will go a long way to reduce rape cases or rape incidents in the society and secondly i do not know what is your point of view concerning the media be it social media the media it is actually worse than the physical society social media does not help at all like for social media i would say it is very terrible extremely terrible you go online you try to click on a site and you get to notice that a lot of pop ups that pop up these days are sexual pop ups almost on every site even clean sites you want to go in maybe you want to download something simple video for work or something they keep popping ads for you apart from that you go online especially for the youth of this age yeah the so called general z it means that their parents can not control what the view online you go to virtually any site you go to their own social media good even cartoons yeah for the younger generations yeah something else yeah i once saw a cartoon well my friend she once watched started watching a cartoon actually it is her kids thinking it was a cartoon i do not know if i am permitted to name the name of the cartoon sure you are yeah but okay like cartoon like sausage party or american dad they are all sexually induced like so social media does not help you they go online they can watch all these things as a parent you might say okay do not watch those programs do not watch that one but they go online they can download it they can download netflix on their phone watch these things they can go on whatsapp and share pictures with each other sure they can go on facebook and watch porn for free go on twitter and see the same thing and some sites might be like yeah hope you are 18 and even if you are not 18 yeah just click and yes sure and nothing happens because there is no means for proper verification sure sure there is no luck and there is no prevention because these sites too like all over the site pay for rights for ads and all that so the online community to me is what start it yeah so social media is a kind of negative role an extremely negative kids do not go online anymore to study sure once they study and they just divert to go and look for one or 2 more interesting things and they end up getting distracted with all these things from the net yeah tomorrow you see them voting and shouting for role models that are not actually role models role models sure people that dress indecently that i just feel like if we were to compare like the incidents of rape way before and now i think it is on the rising do you agree with that yeah i agree with that i actually do agree with that and for me personally i think it is because of the advent of social media because of the advent of you know exposure exposure people we do not call we do not cope we do not cope the screen there is this thing dstv started doing i think some years back that there is parental guide you can lock some certain channels you know for your kids not to have access and i think it is one way that we can use social media and still use it effectively effectively rather to curb all these screen exposures and stuff like that so have you had anyone like directly been a victim of it or have you been a victim of rape no because men are also abused yeah men are also abused i believe that men do not even come out to say it because because they feel like they are manly they come out to say it it is a shameful thing in society it is a shameful thing in the society a lot of men just keep it to themselves and end up with it trying to be manly and all that but men to are victims of rape yeah yeah i had a friend back in the university and he told me he had an aunt that raped him as early as age was he age 10 or 12 and you know each time he is going through a phase in life he just thinks about that and kind of affects his mental health so these are some of the issues that rape does to someone or to a person so i just feel like society should put more measures especially on social media and the family front let parents be intentional about what their kids watch let parents be intentional about the friends their kids keep because peer pressure is something that affects people that are growing up and one thing again is they should also be intentional about what their kids wear wear exactly their kids everything especially young girls yeah sure sure and to the younger girls also and the guys young guys young girls there should be sensation about yeah we know you are just getting to your prime but life just begins here and for you to be at the end of exposure and exposing dresses it only makes your life that is just beginning to end at that point because you could you could be a victim of rape you know there are many things std is what have you that you could have through rape and stuff like that so there should be more orientation there should be more orientation on detrimental issues of it and i think the society will get better bit by bit if we do that

Yes, I once worked in a credit company and in such companies you need a lot of patient, agility, awareness, passion and .

My name is Ruben Mose and I consent to recording this conversation. Welcome very much, Mister Ruben, and we are so much grateful to have you on board. Thank you for the invite. Today we will be discussing about Manchester United, but before we go further, which team do you support? I am a Manchester United supporter. Wow. Yes. Mister Ruben, could you kindly tell us more about Manchester United before we dive into our questions? Okay. Manchester United is a professional football club based in Manchester, England. Founded in 1878, it is one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in the world. The team has a rich history and a large global fanbase. With its home ground at Old Trafford Stadium, Manchester United has won numerous domestic and international titles, including 20 English league titles and three European clubs. The club is known for its iconic red and white jersey and has a sport marking it on mostly renowned and prestigious football clubs in the world. Wow. That's very rich of Manchester United. Now, I want us to dive in our questions. Did you watch or did you catch Manchester United's game last weekend? Yes, I did. And what did you think of their performance? I watched the match between Manchester United and Liverpool. I am a Manchester United fan. What an entertaining match. Manchester United were playing at their home ground, commonly known as Old Strafford. The first half they faced up defeat with Liverpool taking a lead by one. The Manchester United defence was in shambles and they lacked possession of the ball. The possession was also in favour of Liverpool with a percentage of 43% and 57%, with Manchester United lacking a shot on target, while Liverpool enjoying a total of 15 shots and four shots on target. We had three offside decisions and one yellow card from Liverpool's side. Two big chances wasted by Liverpool with several possessions lost by both teams. The second half was a much entertaining as the host Manchester United came from behind to a two one win up to the 84th minute when Mohamed Salah rescued Liverpool and the match ended in a two-two draw. The overall performance we had seven yellow cards, with Manchester United grabbing five yellow cards and Liverpool two yellow cards. We saw young players representing both teams as young as 18 years. Kobbie Mainoo played really well and he was forced out of pitch due to injury on the 85th minute, Manchester United keeper Andre Onana displayed a good performance by saving three crucial saves against Liverpool. The man of the match was Bruno Fernandes, the captain of Manchester United. The players on scoresheet were Bruno Fernandez and Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United, while on the other side of Liverpool, Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah scored the goals. Wow. And I'm really excited to see how Mister Mose, I'm really excited to see how Manchester United will do in the upcoming season. So what player are you most looking forward to watching on the team? I think the team is now working hard and focusing on winning trophies. The goal of the team is to take the club to the next level and play in European Championship or competitions. I'm looking forward watching Kobbie Mainoo play because right now he is performing very well and is trying hard and working very hard to make sure that the team gets positive results. I'm also looking forward to see the captain, Bruno Fernandes unite players on pitch and bring the atmosphere of positive energy in both the pitch and dressing room. I'm also betting on Garnacho to improve and get more goals and work on being the top scorer on the sheet. And lastly, I want to see the performance of Amad Diallo who we want to see him play as he did on his performance while he was at loan at Sunderland. He will for sure be a great bet. We also want to encourage the coach, Erik ten Hag to rotate the squad so that we can see more positive results on the pitch. That was very educative about Manchester United and you almost made me come and to shift from my team. Actually, I'll think about that, but I'm so grateful for the insight, Mr. Mose.

My name is Kelvin Rumbosia and I consent to recording this conversation. Thank you very much Mister Kevin for agreeing to be on board with us today. Speaker C: You are welcome. Today we will be discussing about pros of being multilingual. But before that, what is being multilingual? Multilingual refers to the ability to speak, understand, and use more than one language proficiently. There are numerous benefits to being multilingual which go beyond the practical advantages of being able to communicate with people from different cultural backgrounds. Some of the key pros of being multilingual enhanced conjunctive abilities, increased job opportunities, improved cultural awareness and understanding, easier travel and navigation, and the ability to connect with and understand others. On a deeper level, being multilingual can also boost overall brain function, delay the onset of degenerative disease, and provide a sense of confidence and worldly knowledge. Overall, being able to speak multiple languages can open doors, broaden perspectives, and enrich one's personal and professional life in countless ways. Wow, thank you very much for that. And I was so impressed when I found out you can speak three languages fluently. What would you say are the top advantages of being multilingual? One of them includes enhanced communication skill. Compared to monolingual children, multilingual children are exposed to more diverse social experiences. As a result, multilingual children often become adapt at considering other people's perspective, making them more effective communicators. Another one is high latent linguistic recognition. Babies are able to identify and distinguish linguistic sounds in the different languages used in the household before they actually are physically able to use the language. Research shows that monolingual babies only identify the single language to which they are exposed. This gives multilingual babies a head start on the language learning process. The more exposure the children receive in multiple languages, the more linguistic recognition will occur. The third one is superior executive functioning. Executive functioning skills are connective capabilities that include reasoning, planning, and problem solving. Studies suggest that multilingual children often have better executive functioning skills than their monolingual counterparts, particularly related to areas of inhibition monitoring. This is perhaps because of constant switching of languages in multilingual households. Strong executive functioning skills is significance predictor of academic success. The other advantage is the other advantage is increased career opportunities. Communicating in various languages can give multilingual applicant a clear advantage over monolingual applicant. Speaker 2: In the job field. The international business community considers the ability to communicate in more than one language and in principal tool for relationship building and financial success. This can make it easier to find a job and also can lead to pay increases. Another one is attuned to their surroundings. One key advantage of being multilingual is the ability to continuously monitor the environment. Once a researcher from University of Pompeo Fabra in Spain stated, bilinguals have to switch languages quite often. You may have to talk to your father in one language and your mother in another language. It requires keeping track of changes around you in the same way that we monitor surroundings when driving. This applies. This applies to all aspects of life, whether walking down the street or playing sports. Speaker 2: The other one is delay on onset dementia. Research discovered at the Institute of Medical Science in Hyderabad, India showed that people. Who spoke a second language relayed on onset of aphlazemias for 4.5 years. This is due to the constant mental control of using multiple languages, which exercises the brain and helps to keep it from degenerative delaying. These diseases can increase quality of your life for yourself and for those around you. The other advantage is skilled multitaskers. Multilinguals have been shown to be better multitaskers because of the ability to switch languages. According to researches in the United States news article, when a bilingual speaks two languages, regularly speaking in just one of these languages requires use of the control network to limit interference from the other language and to ensure the continued dominance of the intended language. The other advantage is multiple languages multiplies perspectives. As they learn new language, people often adopt new preferences and perspectives. Researchers have even explained have even examined. Speaker 2: The way in which languages produce a language mindset defined as feeling like a. Different person when using different languages. This may be as a result of varying grammar and structures of language. The other advantage is it improves memory. Speaker C: It improves memory. Memory plays a huge part in learning language. Those who are multilingual often score higher in memory test than those who only use one language. Having a great memory can have both conjective and social benefits like recognizing faces or remember membering names. The last and the least is increased ability to learn additional languages. A recent study found that compared to people who are fluent in only one language, multilingual individuals have an easier time. Speaker 2: Picking up a new language. In fact, the acquisition of multiple languages can help with the process of learning. Speaker 2: New language as well as improve competency in native language. This is because languages reinforce one another and provide tools to strengthen phonological, morphologic and synthetic skill. Wow, thank you for that. And I've always wanted to learn another language, but I'm not sure if it's worth the effort. As someone who is multilingual, what benefits have you experienced from knowing multiple languages. Speaker 2: Learning more languages helps in expanding your mind and worldview. When you learn a new language, you also learn the culture of the people who speak it. You get a deep awareness of the world outside of your bumble and you can see the world from other people's perspective. This is good for a couple of reasons. One, you develop professionally. Two, you develop personally. If you develop professionally. The modern workplace is multicultural. Tolerance and empathy are key. Learning a language boosts those characteristics and makes you an in demand employee when you develop personally. Sure, you could go through life never thinking beyond the borders of your hometown. Lot of people do this and preferably and perfectly are happy. But if you are a lifelong learner who isn't satisfied with staying the same, learning a language broadens your horizon. So what do you think? With your expanded mind and worldview, you get out and meet new people. For every language you speak, you have a whole. You have a who. You have a whole worldview. You get out there and meet new people. For every language you speak, you have a whole bunch of new people to communicate with. So when you are multilingual person who speaks more than two languages frequently, you've got unlimited opportunities to interact with people from all over the world. It also helps you to give you a meaningful experience in your local community and overseas. Many of us who live in multicultural places, there are some people from all over the world living in our doorstep. Being fluent in multiple languages helps you to make connection in these different communities. It's the same when you are traveling. You go oversea and only use English. It's easy and you'll have a good time, but any interactions you have are superficial by default. But if you know multiple languages, you have meaningful conversation. When people all over the world travel experiences become deeper and more meaningful than ever, all by speaking same languages as locals. It also helps you to find a romantic partner. Here are less obvious benefits. Getting a learning or a language can help you find a romantic partner. According to some of many surveys. They always say like that. This also increases your social skills. People who speak multiple languages are more empathetic and can consider other people's points of view. They understand that other people's beliefs, values and opinions are different from theirs and they are accepting of those differences. This improved perspective taking means multilinguals have better social skills. Language is social. It's a tool for communicating with other people. That's why people who learn multiple languages from an early age have better social skills. They are great at monitoring who is saying what and in what language and they can support social partners more easily than monolingual people. It also reduces the risk of mental decline. Conjunctive decline is a huge health issue in the United States. Women have a 37% risk dementia. They always there are ways to delay this, however, one of the best speaking multilingual languages. Another way is it also improves your memory. It also helps you to broaden your mind. And obviously you need to remember a lot to be a fluent language. And memory training spreads to other parts of your life. You will be less likely to forget birthdays and appointments, and you will always know when you left the keys and where you left them. Learning more languages becomes easy. When you learn more languages, it also makes your life to be more easy. It also increases your employability. People with language skills are in high demand. Modern businesses operate in multicultural or international settings. People who can speak multilingual languages are extremely valuable to them. Add your language skills to your resume and watch your employability show. It opens exciting doors and interesting job opportunities. It helps these in the following ways. You can get a job with diplomats or diplomatic job. You can get a job like a translator. You can also get a job as an interpreter. Having or speaking more different languages is healthy and makes you grow better. For that said, I can only say that multilingual is better than monolingual.

I am mpomufuken and I give consent to recording this conversation. And I am retabila Apani. I am giving consent to recording this conversation. All right, so today's topic is child marriage. Yo, that's a toughie. That's a tough one. Yeah. So child marriage, it was described as a harmful practice that refers to any formal marriage. Right. Or informal union between a child under the ages of 18 and an adult or another child, you know. So this is basically a forced marriage... it is Yeah. If you come to think of it, because a child under the age of 18, they are still developing. Now, how can you take that infant and throw them to an adult in a marriage? I mean, marriage is a very hard task. It's very hard itself. Imagine being a child having to, like, do those tasks. Imagine ...that old women can't even obtain. No, they can't. You know, they can't. So I feel that it's child abuse, but however, it's actually being practiced in other cultures. So in other people, it's a culture, you know, whereby you get a child, a girl child at the ages of maybe 10, 12, 14, being married to an old man. Older than their father Older than their fathers, their grandfathers. I actually came across this video On Facebook where a granny married a child. How is that even possible? who does that? Married a child, a seven year old boy. I don't know if I still have that picture, but I took a screenshot of it. I was so moved, you know, I was so moved. I was so emotional. Like, you know, it goes back to that issue of naming children with dead people. You know, other. Other people name their kids by maybe their dead grandmother, dead grandfather, whoever. Now it destroys them, I feel that. Yeah, those kids must be going through a lot. They are. Imagine at the age of 10 to 18, you must still be playing You must still be playing with toys. You know, getting, like, jumping muddy puddles. Trying to find yourself. Yes, but being a wife or a husband at that age. At that age, wow! That must be terrifying. Its very terrifying, it's Terrible. You know, so I really do not agree with this but it's happening in some cultures, so whether we like it or not, it's happening. But then I would say that child marriage, it's an abuse to kids. It is. It's an abuse. You know, as you said, that, you know, a. A 16 year old, a teenager, like, let's just take a teenager for this instance. Those guys are still trying to find themselves. Themselves, Yes. Teenagers don't know anything about themselves. Hence we have so many sections, you know, about teenagers. Everywhere we go, we have books. We have books to help us raise teenagers. We have programs that we sign into to raise teenagers. You know, we do not get along with our teenage children. So imagine that kind of a child being placed in a marriage, you know, even if it's not a child and an adult, sometimes you find that it's actually two kids. Yes. You being married, maybe this one is twelve, that one is six. What happened to getting married because you love each other. Hence, I'm saying that sometimes, it is the culture Dont you think that, when you're talking about the culture, don't you think it's because of poverty and stuff. You know In indian culture, we've see. Have you not seen it in indian cultures? Mostly I have, Yes. And you find that even the bride or the groom, they are unhappy. Always They are unhappy. They are always unhappy And you find that maybe the girl's parents, the mother's not happy, she keeps crying. And the father is just there being bold and saying, you're gonna do this. You're gonna do this. So do you think it's because of poverty or. That kind of culture? I believe that it's poverty. I mean, you can. You cannot send your child to something that you know, that he or she will never handle. I feel that it's because of poverty. Parents sell their kids. Well, that's my opinion. You know? that's my opinion. I feel that parents sell kids for poverty. Or maybe they're just looking out for their children to get a better future or I don't know. And you find that most of the time, even if that's the case, of maybe assisting your kid to get the privileges of a good life, those people, they are so abusive. The rich people are so abusive. They will abuse your kids until your child dies or maybe comes to you crying. That's bad It's very bad. The worst part is they cannot even go back home. No, they cannot. I do not agree with that I'm telling you.",and i give consent to record in this conversation and i am catering i am given consent to record in this conversation all right so today's topic is child

must still be playing with toys you know getting like jumping muddy puddles trying to find yourself yes but being a wife or a husband at that age at that age wow that must be terrifying its very terrifying it is terrible you know so i really do not agree with this but it is happening in some cultures so whether we like it or not it is happening but then i would say that child marriage it is an abuse to kids it is it is an abuse you know as you said that you know a a 16 year old a teenager like let us just take a teenager for this instance those guys are still trying to find themselves themselves yes teenagers do not know anything about themselves hence we have so many sections you know about teenagers everywhere we go we have books we have books to help us raise teenagers we have programs that we sign into to raise teenagers you know we do not get along with our teenage children so imagine that kind of a child being placed in a marriage you know even if it is not a child and an adult sometimes you find that it is actually 2 kids yes you being married maybe this one is 12 that one is 6 what happened to getting married because you love each other hence i am saying that sometimes it is the culture dont you think that when you are talking about the culture do not you think it is because of poverty and stuff you know in indian culture we have see have you not seen it in indian cultures mostly i have yes and you find that even the bride or the groom they are unhappy always they are unhappy they are always unhappy and you find that maybe the girl is parents the mother is not happy she keeps crying and the father is just there being bold and saying you are going to do this you are going to do this so do you think it is because of poverty or that kind of culture i believe that it is poverty i mean you can you cannot send your child to something that you know that he or she will never handle i feel that it is because of poverty parents sell their kids well that is my opinion you know that is my opinion i feel that parents sell kids for poverty or maybe they are just looking out for their children to get a better future or i do not know and you find that most of the time even if that is the case of maybe assisting your kid to get the privileges of a good life those people they are so abusive the rich people are so abusive they will abuse your kids until your child dies or maybe comes to you crying that is bad it is very bad the worst part is they cannot even go back home no they cannot i do not agree with that i am telling you

I am mpomufuken and I give consent to recording this conversation. And I am retabila Apani. I am giving consent to recording this conversation. Alright, so today's topic is bo bo bo. Okay. Um, peer pressure in adolescence. Now, I feel that we have had this conversation for, like, forever. Yes. Because we, we all went through this stage. Yeah, we went through this stage of peer pressure. And so I don't know if you'd like to share something with us regarding this topic. I'd say that peer pressure is a huge influence on adolescents as they navigate the challenges of growing up and forming their identities. Yes. Yes. Right. They actually, in a. They're actually looking for themselves. Yes. In that stage, they do not really. Know who they are or what they are doing. Like me, as, as a young MPO, like, I'm like, who am I? I'm actually in that stage, you know, where I ask myself, who am I? What do I want? What do I want? Yes. So I do, uh, believe that it also refers to the impact that teenagers who are of similar age or age group and interest have on individual thoughts, behaviors and decision making processes, you know? So adolescents often face peer pressure in various forms, both positive and negative, you know, as they seek acceptance and approval from their social circles. Wait, a positive peer influence? Yeah, we have two types of peer influence. You know, we have negative peer influence and also positive, you know, so I've. Never heard of the positive one. Really? You've only heard. Okay, you know, positive peer influence, it can serve a positive role model for teenagers or idolizers. Okay. Yes. Encouraging them to excel academically, you know, participating in activities and develop essential social skills. We do have those kind of people, you know, it doesn't mean that when you are a teenager, you're always thinking of negative stuff. We do have people who are raised properly. Not to say that the ones who have negative impact, who have the negative peer influence were not raised properly. I mean, in this world, we choose who we wanna be. Yeah. You know, so positive peer relationships can foster friendships, you know, provide emotional support and inspire personal growth. Oh, so that's what it is. Yeah, that's what it is. Basically. Lies. Yeah. Would you also like to know about the negative peer influences? Please lead teenagers to encourage I. Or to engage in risky behaviors such as some substance abuse, you know, or early sexual activities. Yeah. That we have seen. And I really do not understand. Why do we have. Why does it contribute, why the negative peer influence contributes a lot more than the positive peer influence? Not to think it's because teenagers are trying to find themselves. Yeah. They're not really mentally stable, I'd say. Because they are still developing. Yes. Yeah, I would say. I would say that. And one other thing, I would actually say maybe the climate change or maybe the world evolving and stuff because they do have an impact on us as human beings. Really? Yeah, that's what I didn't think so. You know, negative influencers from other peers may push individuals to actually confront or conform to, you know, to harmful norms, like making choices that go against their values, you know? Sure, that's bad. It's very bad. But what I like about this, this topic of ours, it doesn't necessarily support only one side. It supports both sides. Both sides. We understand that there are two sides of peer pressure sense in the world. It's not actually one thing because hence I was saying this, we only see bad things that teenagers do. That's. I think that's because teenagers often do those bad things more than good things. I don't know. I don't know. But then, you know what? I'll just trust you there. But we do have teenagers, but they are there, you know? So I also feel that we should. We as parents, as the society, we should support our teenage children, you know, we should support them in order that. In order that they make better decisions in life. Meaning that's a positive influence. That's a positive influence, you know? Yes, but you know what? I remember when I used to be a teenager because believe me, I've been. Been there. Even though I am, I am an adult. I've been there. But whatever. What I see, what I see, the teen, our, today's teenagers are actually not like us in our days when we were teenagers. How is that? It's totally two different generation, you know? Okay, would you like to elaborate? Yes. We did have a peer pressure in our days, but it wasn't as strong as what we see these days. I mean, in our times, the peer pressure that we had, it was about, you know, being your favorite mom, being your. Sorry. Being your favorite child amongst your siblings and stuff. You know, it wasn't all about the influence outside, really. Yes, it wasn't. It wasn't all about the influence outside. It started in the house. Everything started in the house. I wanted to be better than everyone else, than my sister, to my mother, you know? But in today's. In today's world, teenagers have peer pressure. Like, it's very strong these days. You know, they compete, especially with friends, also with celebrities, with friends and stuff. So it's not only at home. It's not only at home. It's always from the outside, actually. Yeah. With friends or classmates, you know, teammates maybe. When you take part in sports at school, whatever social trends, you know, that is the most dangerous one, because I see today's kids, when they see something on the Internet, they want to try. It, which is not always a good thing. It isn't. They want to try it, and they want it to work for them. They try so hard. They try so hard, and it's damaging. It's damaging. It's a very negative influence on them, you know? Do you think role models often play a positive or a negative influence? Role models? Yes. From teenagers. From teenagers. I actually feel that it depends on the celebrity. No, sorry, the role model. Because we do not conduct ourselves the same. You know, we do have. For an example, we do have celebrities. Some of them you can actually learn from. Some of them you cannot learn from. You understand? So I feel. Yeah, I feel that it goes both ways. We do have role models that we can look up to, you know? So is there anything that you'd maybe like to share from your teenage perspective? No. You don't want to share anything. How about my school life? Yo, my school life was a hell. What. What happened Filas there for? It was bad. Yeah. I mean, I was always that quiet kid at school, you know, so, like, I wasn't trying so hard to fit. In, but I think it's a positive one. Okay. Yeah. It is a positive peer pressure. It is a positive sign, because trying to fit in actually takes you to stages where you risk your life in order for you to fit in, you know? Yeah. You find that maybe at school there was this group of ladies they. Yeah. You see? So I feel that they had their signatures where they did whatever they did. Maybe they went to parties, they had drugs, they took their drugs, they took alcohol. They took part in sexual activities at a young age. It's always the popular girls. It's always the popular girls. Always. Whoa. You know what? I've just remembered something. I've just remembered something from my teenage days when I used to attend my high school. So there was this lady who, in the same class, she had her friends. I mean, I wasn't in their league. I won't lie to you. I was not in their league. So they would always go out for parties on weekends. They would wear short skirts. Not to say that girls with short skirts have bad intentions or whatever, I'm just saying, like, that was their signature. They used to wear very short skirts. They used to prepare their hair. Their hair was up to date. They would wear makeup and in, nowadays, you wouldn't wear makeup, but they would wear makeup, you know, meaning they were popular. They were popular, you know. And I had this friend of mine who wanted to. She knew the other lady from the group. From that group. So that lady, my friend, wanted us to join them. And because I wasn't that big of a. I was also not seeking for popularity or whatever. Yeah. Acceptance from others, as I told you that. You know what? I used to have that pressure at home, you know, I wanna be better. I wanna be better more than my sister. I wanna do my chores. And my mom, when she comes from work, I wanna show her mom, this is what I did. This is what I did, you know? Yeah, that's it. That. That was the only acceptance, I don't wanna lie, that I wanted, you know, in those age. Yeah. So you know what? My friend joined them. Were you guys friends after that? No, we were, like, speaking to each other and that was it. We were never friends anymore. Because she got consumed and they were expelled at school. They were expelled because they were rebellious. They didn't do their schoolwork. They used to backchat at teachers. After she joined the group, she would backchat. She was back chatting, and then she took herself, like, she distanced herself, herself from me. And I heard that she was here and I heard that. I heard that she started drinking alcohol age, and she actually got fell pregnant. You know, that's tough. If I can see, if you can see her today, you'll never agree that. I'll show you a picture of her when you were in high school. You will never agree that that is actually her. So she got caught in the negative influence, peer pressure influence. But when we were together, I wouldn't want to lie. We used to have that positive influence towards each other of doing our schoolwork and doing our chores. Yes. So, yeah, it's a.",all right i am perm and i give consent to recording this conversation and i am catabla al pani i am giving consent to recording this conversation all right so today's topic is okay um peer pressure in a dorisence now um i feel that we have had this conversation for like forever you know time ali four because we we all went through this stage yeah we went through this stage of peer pressure and adults and so i don't know if you'd like to share something with us regarding this topic i'd say that peer pressure is a huge influence on adolescents as they navigate the challenges of going up and forming their their identities they actually looking for themselves yes in that stage they do not know who they are what they are doing like me as a young where my i'm actually in that stage you know where i ask myself where so i do believe that it also to impact that teenagers who are age group and interest have on individual thoughts behaviors and decision making process you know so adolescents often face peer pressure in various forms both positive and negative you know as they seek acceptance and approval from their social circles a positive peer influence we have two types of peer influence you know we have near to peer influence and also positive you know so never heard of the positive one really you heard ok you know positive peer influence it can serve a positive role model for teenagers or ideas encouraging them to excel academically you know participating in activities and develop essential social skills we do have those kind of people you know it doesn't mean that when you are a teenager you're always thinking of negative stuff we do have people who are raised not to say that the ones who have negative impact who have negative peer influence were not to raise properly i mean in this world we choose who we want to be you know positive peer relationships can foster friendships you know provide emotional support and inspire personal growth also that's what it is that's what it is basically to encourage or to engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse you know sexual activities that years in entering i really do not understand why do we have why does it contribute peer influence contributes a lot more than the positive peer influence think it's because teenagers are trying to find themselves they're not really mentally stable i'd say because they're still developing say i would say that one other thing i would actually say maybe climate change or maybe the world evolving stuff these two have an impact on so you know negative influences from other peers may push individuals to actually confront or confirm to you know to harmful norms like making chases that you know that's bad it's very bad but what i like about this this this topic of ours doesn't necessarily support only one side supports both sides we understand that there are two sides of of peer pressure in the world not actually wealthy because as i was seeing this we only see bad things that just i think that's because teenagers often do those bad more than good things i don't know i don't know if it's and you know that we do have teenage we as parents yes as the society we should support our children you know we should support that they make better decisions in life meaning that's a positive influence there's a positive influence but you know what i remember uh when i used to be a teenager because believe me i've been there even though i am an adult i've been there but whatever i see what i see the teen today's teenagers are actually not like us in our case when teenagers how is that it's totally two different generation you know have a peer pressure wasn't as strong as what we see these days i mean in our time the peer pressure that we have it as about being your favorite mom being a story being your favorite amongst your siblings and stuff you know it wasn't all about the influence outside really yes it wasn't it wasn't all about the influence outside it started in the house everything started to the house i wanted to be better my sister to my mother you know but in today's uh in today's world teenagers have peer pressure like it's it's very strong these days you know they compete especially with friends also with celebrities with twins and stuff so it's not only at home it's not only at home it it's it's always from the outside actually yeah with friends or classmates you know teammates maybe when you take part in sports at school whatever social trends that is the most dangerous one because i see today's kids when they see something on the internet they want to try it which is not always a good thing it isn't the one and they want it to work for them they try so hard they try so hard and if it's damaging it's a very negative influence on them you know do you think home models play a positive or a negative influence role models from teenagers i actually feel that it depends on the celebrity no sorry the role model because we do not conduct ourselves the you know we do have for an example we do have celebrities some of them can actually learn from some of them you cannot learn from you understand so i feel i feel that it both ways we do have that you can work up to anything that you like to share from perspective you want to say anything hello i don't like hail was what happened feel us there for me it was bad i mean i was always that quiet kid at school you know so like i wasn't trying trying so hard to fit in but i think it's a positive one okay ya it is a positive peer pressure it is a positive side because trying to fit in actually takes you to stages where you risk your life in order for you to fit in you find that maybe at school there was this group of ladies of i feel that they had their signatures where they did whatever they did maybe they went to parties they had drugs they took their drugs they took alcohol they took part in sexual activities at a young age it's almost it's

signature they used to wish very short skirts they used to prepare their hair he was up to date they would wear make up and in our days you wouldn't wear make up but they would wear make up you know meaning they were popular they were popular you know and i had this friend of mine who wanted to she knew the other lady from the group so that laid my friend wanted us to join them and because i

that it depends on the celebrity. no, sorry, the role model. because we do not conduct ourselves the same. you know, we do have. for an example, we do have celebrities. some of them you can actually learn from. some of them you cannot learn from. you understand? so i feel. yeah, i feel that it goes both ways. we do have role models that we can look up to, you know? so is there anything that you'd maybe like to share from your teenage perspective? no. you don't want to share anything. how about my school life? yo, my school life was a hell. what. what happened filas there for? it was bad. yeah. i mean, i was always that quiet kid at school, you know, so, like, i wasn't trying so hard to fit. in, but i think it's a positive one. okay. yeah. it is a positive peer pressure. it is a positive sign, because trying to fit in actually takes you to stages where you risk your life in order for you to fit in, you know? yeah. you find that maybe at school there was this group of ladies they. yeah. you see? so i feel that they had their signatures where they did whatever they did. maybe they went to parties, they had drugs, they took their drugs, they took alcohol. they took part in sexual activities at a young age. it's always the popular girls. it's always the popular girls. always. whoa. you know what? i've just remembered something. i've just remembered something from my teenage days when i used to attend my high school. so there was this lady who, in the same class, she had her friends. i mean, i wasn't in their league. i won't lie to you. i was not in their league. so they would always go out for parties on weekends. they would wear short skirts. not to say that girls with short skirts have bad intentions or whatever, i'm just saying, like, that was their signature. they used to wear very short skirts. they used to prepare their hair. their hair was up to date. they would wear makeup and in, nowadays, you wouldn't wear makeup, but they would wear makeup, you know, meaning they were popular. they were popular, you know. and i had this friend of mine who wanted to. she knew the other lady from the group. from that group. so that lady, my friend, wanted us to join them. and because i wasn't that big of a. i was also not seeking for popularity or whatever. yeah. acceptance from others, as i told you that. you know what? i used to have that pressure at home, you know, i wanna be better. i wanna be better more than my sister. i wanna do my chores. and my mom, when she comes from work, i wanna show her mom, this is what i did. this is what i did, you know? yeah, that's it. that. that was the only acceptance, i don't wanna lie, that i wanted, you know, in those age. yeah. so you know what? my friend joined them. were you guys friends after that? no, we were, like, speaking to each other and that was it. we were never friends anymore. because she got consumed and they were expelled at school. they were expelled because they were rebellious. they didn't do their schoolwork. they used to backchat at teachers. after she joined the group, she would backchat. she was back chatting, and then she took herself, like, she distanced herself, herself from me. and i heard that she was here and i heard that. i heard that she started drinking alcohol age, and she actually got fell pregnant. you know, that's tough. if i can see, if you can see her today, you'll never agree that. i'll show you a picture of her when you were in high school. you will never agree that that is actually her. so she got caught in the negative influence, peer pressure influence. but when we were together, i wouldn't want to lie. we used to have that positive influence towards each other of doing our schoolwork and doing our chores. yes. so, yeah, it's a.",0.38038548752834467,all right i am perm and i give consent to recording this conversation and i am catabla al pani i am giving consent to recording this conversation all right so today is topic is okay peer pressure in a dorisence now i feel that we have had this conversation for like forever you know time ali 4 because we we all went through this stage yeah we went through this stage of peer pressure and adults and so i do not know if you would like to share something with us regarding this topic i would say that peer pressure is a huge influence on adolescents as they navigate the challenges of going up and forming their their identities they actually looking for themselves yes in that stage they do not know who they are what they are doing like me as a young where my i am actually in that stage you know where i ask myself where so i do believe that it also to impact that teenagers who are age group and interest have on individual thoughts behaviors and decision making process you know so adolescents often face peer pressure in various forms both +and negative you know as they seek acceptance and approval from their social circles a positive peer influence we have 2 types of peer influence you know we have near to peer influence and also positive you know so never heard of the +one really you heard ok you know positive peer influence it can serve a positive role model for teenagers or ideas encouraging them to excel academically you know participating in activities and develop essential social skills we do have those kind of people you know it does not mean that when you are a teenager you are always thinking of negative stuff we do have people who are raised not to say that the ones who have negative impact who have negative peer influence were not to raise properly i mean in this world we choose who we want to be you know positive peer relationships can foster friendships you know provide emotional support and inspire personal growth also that is what it is that is what it is basically to encourage or to engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse you know sexual activities that years in entering i really do not understand why do we have why does it contribute peer influence contributes a lot more than the positive peer influence think it is because teenagers are trying to find themselves they are not really mentally stable i would say because they are still developing say i would say that one other thing i would actually say maybe climate change or maybe the world evolving stuff these 2 have an impact on so you know negative influences from other peers may push individuals to actually confront or confirm to you know to harmful norms like making chases that you know that is bad it is very bad but what i like about this this this topic of ours does not necessarily support only one side supports both sides we understand that there are 2 sides of of peer pressure in the world not actually wealthy because as i was seeing this we only see bad things that just i think that is because teenagers often do those bad more than good things i do not know i do not know if it is and you know that we do have teenage we as parents yes as the society we should support our children you know we should support that they make better decisions in life meaning that is a positive influence there is a positive influence but you know what i remember when i used to be a teenager because believe me i have been there even though i am an adult i have been there but whatever i see what i see the teen today is teenagers are actually not like us in our case when teenagers how is that it is totally 2 different generation you know have a peer pressure was not as strong as what we see these days i mean in our time the peer pressure that we have it as about being your favorite mom being a story being your favorite amongst your siblings and stuff you know it was not all about the influence outside really yes it was not it was not all about the influence outside it started in the house everything started to the house i wanted to be better my sister to my mother you know but in today is in today is world teenagers have peer pressure like it is it is very strong these days you know they compete especially with friends also with celebrities with twins and stuff so it is not only at home it is not only at home it it is it is always from the outside actually yeah with friends or classmates you know teammates maybe when you take part in sports at school whatever social trends that is the most dangerous one because i see today is kids when they see something on the internet they want to try it which is not always a good thing it is not the one and they want it to work for them they try so hard they try so hard and if it is damaging it is a very negative influence on them you know do you think home models play a positive or a negative influence role models from teenagers i actually feel that it depends on the celebrity no sorry the role model because we do not conduct ourselves the you know we do have for an example we do have celebrities some of them can actually learn from some of them you cannot learn from you understand so i feel i feel that it both ways we do have that you can work up to anything that you like to share from perspective you want to say anything hello i do not like hail was what happened feel us there for me it was bad i mean i was always that quiet kid at school you know so like i was not trying trying so hard to fit in but i think it is a +one okay ya it is a positive peer pressure it is a positive side because trying to fit in actually takes you to stages where you risk your life in order for you to fit in you find that maybe at school there was this group of ladies of i feel that they had their signatures where they did whatever they did maybe they went to parties they had drugs they took their drugs they took alcohol they took part in sexual activities at a young age it is almost it is always the popular girl you know i have just remembered something i have just remembered something from my teenies days when i used to attend my high school so there was this lady in the same class she hated i mean i was not in the league and i will not in the league so they would always go out for parties on weekends where short skirts not to say that girls with short skirts have been just their signature they used to wish very short skirts they used to prepare their hair he was up to date they would wear make up and in our days you would not wear make up but they would wear make up you know meaning they were popular they were popular you know and i had this friend of mine who wanted to she knew the other lady from the group so that laid my friend wanted us to join them and because i was not that big of a i was also not seeking for popularity or whatever acceptance from others as i told you that you know what i used to that pressure at home you know i want to be better i want to be more than my sister i want to do my chores and my mum when she comes from work i want to show her mum this is what i did this is what i did you know that that was the only acceptance i do not want to like that i want it you know in those age yeah so you know what my friend joined them maybe were you guys friends after that no we were like speaking to each other and that was it we were never friends anymore because she got consumed and they were expelled at school they were because they were rebellious they did not do their schoolwork they used to bag chat at teachers after she joined the group she would bake chat she was chatting and then she took herself like distanced herself herself from me and i heard that she was drinking age and she actually got pregnant if i can see if you can see her today you never show you a picture of her in high school you will never so she got caught in the influence yes fabrication influence but when we were together i i would not want to lie we used to have that positive influence towards each other of doing our school work and doing our chores yes so yeah it is it is a,all right i am mpomufuken and i give consent to recording this conversation and i am retabila apani i am giving consent to recording this conversation alright so today is topic is bo bo bo okay peer pressure in adolescence now i feel that we have had this conversation for like forever yes because we we all went through this stage yeah we went through this stage of peer pressure and so i do not know if you would like to share something with us regarding this topic i would say that peer pressure is a huge influence on adolescents as they navigate the challenges of growing up and forming their identities yes yes right they actually in a they are actually looking for themselves yes in that stage they do not really know who they are or what they are doing like me as as a young mpo like i am like who am i i am actually in that stage you know where i ask myself who am i what do i want what do i want yes so i do believe that it also refers to the impact that teenagers who are of similar age or age group and interest have on individual thoughts behaviors and decision making processes you know so adolescents often face peer pressure in various forms both +and negative you know as they seek acceptance and approval from their social circles wait a positive peer influence yeah we have 2 types of peer influence you know we have negative peer influence and also positive you know so i have never heard of the +one really you have only heard okay you know positive peer influence it can serve a positive role model for teenagers or idolizers okay yes encouraging them to excel academically you know participating in activities and develop essential social skills we do have those kind of people you know it does not mean that when you are a teenager you are always thinking of negative stuff we do have people who are raised properly not to say that the ones who have negative impact who have the negative peer influence were not raised properly i mean in this world we choose who we want to be yeah you know so positive peer relationships can foster friendships you know provide emotional support and inspire personal growth 0 so that is what it is yeah that is what it is basically lies yeah would you also like to know about the negative peer influences please lead teenagers to encourage i or to engage in risky behaviors such as some substance abuse you know or early sexual activities yeah that we have seen and i really do not understand why do we have why does it contribute why the negative peer influence contributes a lot more than the positive peer influence not to think it is because teenagers are trying to find themselves yeah they are not really mentally stable i would say because they are still developing yes yeah i would say i would say that and one other thing i would actually say maybe the climate change or maybe the world evolving and stuff because they do have an impact on us as human beings really yeah that is what i did not think so you know negative influencers from other peers may push individuals to actually confront or conform to you know to harmful norms like making choices that go against their values you know sure that is bad it is very bad but what i like about this this topic of ours it does not necessarily support only one side it supports both sides both sides we understand that there are 2 sides of peer pressure sense in the world it is not actually one thing because hence i was saying this we only see bad things that teenagers do that is i think that is because teenagers often do those bad things more than good things i do not know i do not know but then you know what i will just trust you there but we do have teenagers but they are there you know so i also feel that we should we as parents as the society we should support our teenage children you know we should support them in order that in order that they make better decisions in life meaning that is a positive influence that is a positive influence you know yes but you know what i remember when i used to be a teenager because believe me i have been been there even though i am i am an adult i have been there but whatever what i see what i see the teen our today is teenagers are actually not like us in our days when we were teenagers how is that it is totally 2 different generation you know okay would you like to elaborate yes we did have a peer pressure in our days but it was not as strong as what we see these days i mean in our times the peer pressure that we had it was about you know being your favorite mom being your sorry being your favorite child amongst your siblings and stuff you know it was not all about the influence outside really yes it was not it was not all about the influence outside it started in the house everything started in the house i wanted to be better than everyone else than my sister to my mother you know but in today is in today is world teenagers have peer pressure like it is very strong these days you know they compete especially with friends also with celebrities with friends and stuff so it is not only at home it is not only at home it is always from the outside actually yeah with friends or classmates you know teammates maybe when you take part in sports at school whatever social trends you know that is the most dangerous one because i see today is kids when they see something on the internet they want to try it which is not always a good thing it is not they want to try it and they want it to work for them they try so hard they try so hard and it is damaging it is damaging it is a very negative influence on them you know do you think role models often play a positive or a negative influence role models yes from teenagers from teenagers i actually feel that it depends on the celebrity no sorry the role model because we do not conduct ourselves the same you know we do have for an example we do have celebrities some of them you can actually learn from some of them you cannot learn from you understand so i feel yeah i feel that it goes both ways we do have role models that we can look up to you know so is there anything that you would maybe like to share from your teenage perspective no you do not want to share anything how about my school life yo my school life was a hell what what happened filas there for it was bad yeah i mean i was always that quiet kid at school you know so like i was not trying so hard to fit

My name is Tau Mufugeng and I give consent to recording this conversation. Alright, so today's topic is friendship. So I feel that it's a very beautiful topic, or rather conversation. What's your view on friendship? My view on friendship? All right. Firstly, when we talk about friendship, to me, we are actually talking about something beautiful, something pure, you know, something, something out of this world, you know, because to me, a friendship is a very beautiful relationship going on between two people. It can't be like more than two people, like a group. Yeah. Yes, yes, you're correct. So a friendship is a relationship of mutual affection, you know, between people that goes beyond, mere association. So it's not about just meeting, you know, it's deeper than that. It's deeper than that, yes. It's not about you guys meeting maybe for, for rugby club meeting, you know, or anything like that, or family meetings. Like when you meet, my God, it's. You go like, it's something beautiful, my guys. So I feel that it represents a very strong interpersonal bond where people choose to be with one another, you know, where they're choosing to enjoy spending time together. Yes. And providing positive and supportive roles for one another you know. And common features that are known for friendships are trust. Yes. Shared values most of the time, like keeping in each other like company and like supporting one another, you know, the enjoyment of people being around each other. Yeah. You know? Yeah. But I feel that we have too many different friendships, wouldn't you agree? Because I used to have a childhood friend, you know, I used to have childhood, in fact, childhood friends, which now we are, we actually do not interact anymore, but we're not friends anymore. But at the same time, we do not have bad blood to, between each other. Yes. When we meet, when we meet maybe in the malls or wherever, we get excited, you know, to see each other. We remember that bond that we used to have as children, you know. So I feel that friendship has too many stages and then I feel that it also has the adolescent stage, you know, where teenager. Yeah, where teenager becomes more giving, you know, sharing more, being frank and yes, and very special, you know, because I feel that teenagers rely on, rely very heavy, heavily on their friendship, on their, yes, yeah, you know, and companionship as they navigate, as they navigate the challenges in the developmental stage. So friendship in adolescence plays a very crucial role in shaping social skills, you know. Emotional well being, and self identity. Yes, yes. You know, so a friendship is a very beautiful thing. It's a very beautiful thing. People sharing really beautiful emotions and memories. But how do you feel about a child being a friend with their parents? Is it possible? Yeah, it is possible. It is a good thing because. Because most of the time, just because they are your parents, you get scared of them. Like, you should have, like, some bond that you should not, like, disrespect them, but disrespect, but respect them still having not to be scared and yeah, having fun. Yes. So I also read somewhere about child and parent friendship, that as parents, you shouldn't be friends with your kids. You know, a lady once told me that, you know what? You shouldn't be friends with your kids because they, they get too, too comfortable with, with you guys. That's why I said you must have some level of respect. Yes. But not, like, being scared, because, like, most people ask you their parents. Yes. So you're saying that you should be friends, but you should have limits. Limits, yes. Yeah. Yeah. I do agree with. It's like, It's like when you're having a mutual friend, like, yeah, your friend. Your friend has a friend, like, you are not that tapped in, but we have to, like, always. You have. You always meet each other? Some things like that. Yes. So obviously, you're not gonna tell him or her everything. She's not gonna. She or he's not gonna tell you everything. Yeah. You have some level of respect that you don't know this person. Yes. So you don't really, like, open up that too, that much. Yeah. No, I do agree with you. And, , I also feel that. Yeah, and I also feel that it's a great thing as a parent to be, to become friends with your kids because I feel that you would understand them better. Yes. You know, you would understand all their emotions and stuff. And you'll be more free to, like, open up to your parents for some things happening, like maybe at school getting bullied. Sometimes you don't tell your parents, but, like, having that friendship and that trust you build up on, you can tell them openly. Yeah. You can open up to them. You become open. You become open, you know, which is a good thing. Which is a good thing, because in that way, you guys, you will be able to, to control every situation that your child comes in their way. No, that's a very nice, that's a very nice point to get there. So, you know, there are a lot of things going on in friendships, you know, not always positive stuff. Not always. We don't have positive effects in friendships. Only we do have negative effects. Yes. You know, like a friendship. I feel that a good friendship can be destroyed by two friends lending each other money. You know, money has always been the root of the problem between everyone. Not only in friendship, also in families, also at work places and everywhere, you know Gotta be two sided, not one sided. Yes, yes, and also, like, now we actually looking at the negative effect on friendships. Hey, now you find that you, my friend, and you've just opened up your shop, you know, so whenever I don't have the cash to buy whatever I need, I just go to your shop thinking that you will give me. Yeah. For free or maybe on credit and stuff. And you find out that the laws that you put it at your store doesn't allow anyone to take credit or give. People don't understand that when you give stuff to people that you should be selling to others, they are actually destroying you. Exactly, you know. So friendship and friendships, some, some friendships end like that because you think it's one sided. Yeah. Like, because the person cannot give you everything. Like, sometimes you gotta count on yourself too. Yes. No, you're correct. So, yeah, but friendship is a very beautiful affection, you know, between people and I still say that I really love friendships. You know, they come up. It's a beautiful name and even when you say friendship, or maybe when your, when your friend call you and when you pick up the phone, she's like, or, he's like, but when she's a girl, she's like, hi, friend and you're like, hi, friend, how are you? You know, it's a beautiful. Yeah, that happiness, you, it gives you some kind of peace. You know, there are some certain stuff that you can actually tell them that you're not able. Yes, that you can't tell anyone. And you guys will be like, yo, bro, what up, bro? Where have you been, bro? And stuff.",my name is and i give consent to record in these conversation my name is tom and i give consent to put in this conversation all right so today's topic is friendship so i feel that it's a very beautiful topic or rather conversation what's your what's your view on friendship my view on friendship alright firstly when we talk about friendship to me we are actually talking about something beautiful something pure you know something something out of this world you know because to me a friendship is a it's a it's a very beautiful relationship going on between two people can be like so a friendship is a relationship of mutual affection you know between people that goes beyond mere association so it's not about just meeting you know it's deeper than that it's deeper than that yes it's not about you guys meeting maybe for for for rug rugby club meeting you know or anything like that or family meetings like when you my god it's like it's something beautiful my guy so i feel that it represent a very strong interpersonal where people choose to be with one another you know where they're choosing to enjoy spending time together years and providing positive in supportive rules for one another you know and features that i know friendships trust yes shared values keeping in each other like company and like supporting one another you know they enjoyment of people being around each other you know yeah but i feel that you have too many different friendships wouldn't you like because uh i used to have a childhood friend you know i used to have uh childhood in fact childhood friends which now we are we actually do not uh interact anymore we're not friends anymore but at the same time we do not have blood between each other yes when we meet when we meet maybe in the malls or wherever we get excited you know to see each other we remember that bond that we to have as children that friendship has too many stages and then i feel that it also has to listen you know where signature becomes more you know sharing more being friend and some years and the respect you know because i feel that teenagers rely on relay very heavy heavily on their friendship you know and companionship as they navigate if they navigate the challenges in the development of the first ship in adolescence plays a very crucial role social skills you know well you know and friendship is a very beautiful thing it's a very beautiful thing people sharing really beautiful emotions and memories but how do you feel about a child being a friend is it possible it is a good thing because because most of the time just because they're your parents you get them have like some bond that you should not like disrespect them but respect them still having not to be having fun so i also read somewhere about child parent friendship that as parent you shouldn't be friends with your kids you know a lady once told me that you know what you shouldn't be friends with your kids because they they get too too comfortable with you guys that's why i say you must have some level of respect yes but not like being scared because most people are scared of their parents so you think that uh you should be friends but you should have limits limits ya i do agree with you it's like it's like when you having a mutual friend like ya your friend your friend has a friend like you are not that type in but you have to like always you have you always meet each other something like that so obviously not going to tell him she's not going to she's not going to tell you everything you have some level of respect that you don't know this person so you don't really like total open up that to much and i also feel that it's a it's a great thing as a parent to be to become friends with your kids because i feel that you understand them better you know all their emotions and stuff and you'll be more free to like open up to your parents for some things happening like maybe at school getting bullied sometimes you don't tell your parents but like having that friendship and that trust you build up on you can tell them you become open you know which is a good thing which is a good thing because in that to you guys you'll be able to control every situation that your child is in your way comes in their way no that's a very nice that's a very nice uh point to get there so uh you know there a lot of things going on in friendships you know not always positive stuff uh yes not always we don't have positive effect in friendships only we do have negative effect you know like a friendship i feel that a good friendship can be destroyed by by two friends lending each other money you know money has always been the root problem of the problem between everyone not only in friendship also in families also to work places and everywhere not one side yes and also like now we actually looking at the negative effect on friendship now you find that you my friend and you just open up your shop you know so whenever i don't have the cash to buy whatever i need go to your shop thinking that you would give you for free or maybe on credit and stuff and find out that the laws that you put it your store doesn't allow anyone to take credit that when you give stuff to people that you should be selling to others that actually just doing it exactly you know friendship and friendships something and like that because you think it's one sided because the person cannot friendship is a very beautiful affection you know between people and i still say that i really love friendships you know they come

tau mufugeng and i give consent to recording this conversation. alright, so today's topic is friendship. so i feel that it's a very beautiful topic, or rather conversation. what's your view on friendship? my view on friendship? all right. firstly, when we talk about friendship, to me, we are actually talking about something beautiful, something pure, you know, something, something out of this world, you know, because to me, a friendship is a very beautiful relationship going on between two people. it can't be like more than two people, like a group. yeah. yes, yes, you're correct. so a friendship is a relationship of mutual affection, you know, between people that goes beyond, mere association. so it's not about just meeting, you know, it's deeper than that. it's deeper than that, yes. it's not about you guys meeting maybe for, for rugby club meeting, you know, or anything like that, or family meetings. like when you meet, my god, it's. you go like, it's something beautiful, my guys. so i feel that it represents a very strong interpersonal bond where people choose to be with one another, you know, where they're choosing to enjoy spending time together. yes. and providing positive and supportive roles for one another you know. and common features that are known for friendships are trust. yes. shared values most of the time, like keeping in each other like company and like supporting one another, you know, the enjoyment of people being around each other. yeah. you know? yeah. but i feel that we have too many different friendships, wouldn't you agree? because i used to have a childhood friend, you know, i used to have childhood, in fact, childhood friends, which now we are, we actually do not interact anymore, but we're not friends anymore. but at the same time, we do not have bad blood to, between each other. yes. when we meet, when we meet maybe in the malls or wherever, we get excited, you know, to see each other. we remember that bond that we used to have as children, you know. so i feel that friendship has too many stages and then i feel that it also has the adolescent stage, you know, where teenager. yeah, where teenager becomes more giving, you know, sharing more, being frank and yes, and very special, you know, because i feel that teenagers rely on, rely very heavy, heavily on their friendship, on their, yes, yeah, you know, and companionship as they navigate, as they navigate the challenges in the developmental stage. so friendship in adolescence plays a very crucial role in shaping social skills, you know. emotional well being, and self identity. yes, yes. you know, so a friendship is a very beautiful thing. it's a very beautiful thing. people sharing really beautiful emotions and memories. but how do you feel about a child being a friend with their parents? is it possible? yeah, it is possible. it is a good thing because. because most of the time, just because they are your parents, you get scared of them. like, you should have, like, some bond that you should not, like, disrespect them, but disrespect, but respect them still having not to be scared and yeah, having fun. yes. so i also read somewhere about child and parent friendship, that as parents, you shouldn't be friends with your kids. you know, a lady once told me that, you know what? you shouldn't be friends with your kids because they, they get too, too comfortable with, with you guys. that's why i said you must have some level of respect. yes. but not, like, being scared, because, like, most people ask you their parents. yes. so you're saying that you should be friends, but you should have limits. limits, yes. yeah. yeah. i do agree with. it's like, it's like when you're having a mutual friend, like, yeah, your friend. your friend has a friend, like, you are not that tapped in, but we have to, like, always. you have. you always meet each other? some things like that. yes. so obviously, you're not gonna tell him or her everything. she's not gonna. she or he's not gonna tell you everything. yeah. you have some level of respect that you don't know this person. yes. so you don't really, like, open up that too, that much. yeah. no, i do agree with you. and, , i also feel that. yeah, and i also feel that it's a great thing as a parent to be, to become friends with your kids because i feel that you would understand them better. yes. you know, you would understand all their emotions and stuff. and you'll be more free to, like, open up to your parents for some things happening, like maybe at school getting bullied. sometimes you don't tell your parents, but, like, having that friendship and that trust you build up on, you can tell them openly. yeah. you can open up to them. you become open. you become open, you know, which is a good thing. which is a good thing, because in that way, you guys, you will be able to, to control every situation that your child comes in their way. no, that's a very nice, that's a very nice point to get there. so, you know, there are a lot of things going on in friendships, you know, not always positive stuff. not always. we don't have positive effects in friendships. only we do have negative effects. yes. you know, like a friendship. i feel that a good friendship can be destroyed by two friends lending each other money. you know, money has always been the root of the problem between everyone. not only in friendship, also in families, also at work places and everywhere, you know gotta be two sided, not one sided. yes, yes, and also, like, now we actually looking at the negative effect on friendships. hey, now you find that you, my friend, and you've just opened up your shop, you know, so whenever i don't have the cash to buy whatever i need, i just go to your shop thinking that you will give me. yeah. for free or maybe on credit and stuff. and you find out that the laws that you put it at your store doesn't allow anyone to take credit or give. people don't understand that when you give stuff to people that you should be selling to others, they are actually destroying you. exactly, you know. so friendship and friendships, some, some friendships end like that because you think it's one sided. yeah. like, because the person cannot give you everything. like, sometimes you gotta count on yourself too. yes. no, you're correct. so, yeah, but friendship is a very beautiful affection, you know, between people and i still say that i really love friendships. you know, they come up. it's a beautiful name and even when you say friendship, or maybe when your, when your friend call you and when you pick up the phone, she's like, or, he's like, but when she's a girl, she's like, hi, friend and you're like, hi, friend, how are you? you know, it's a beautiful. yeah, that happiness, you, it gives you some kind of peace. you know, there are some certain stuff that you can actually tell them that you're not able. yes, that you can't tell anyone. and you guys will be like, yo, bro, what up, bro? where have you been, bro? and stuff.",0.39780736100234926,my name is and i give consent to record in these conversation my name is

My name is Mary Muihaki and I consent to recording this conversation. Mary Muihaki, welcome to our today's program. I'm so much humbled to be with you on board today. Okay, today we are discussing about teenage pregnancy. Kindly let us know what is teenage pregnancy? Thank you very much and I will give a brief of what is teenage pregnancy? According to my understanding now, teenage pregnancy refers to the situation in which a girl aged between 13 and 19 becomes pregnant. It is a global issue that affects not only the pregnant girl but also her family as well as the community. Teenage pregnancy can have negative consequences for both the mother and child, including health risks, socio stigmatization and barrier to education and employment opportunities. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive sex education, access to reproductive healthcare and support for young parents. Wow. Thank you for that brief explanation. And to our first question, did you hear about the recent rise in teenage pregnancies? Yes, and that made me feel so heartbroken. What do you think could be the reason behind it? Now some of the causes of the high rise of the teenage pregnancy when we have school dropouts, pregnant girls often drop out of schools, limiting opportunities for future employment and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Now we also have married adolescents. In this case, adolescent pregnancy can also have negative social and economic effects on girls. Their families and communities will be affected by this. We have socioeconomics, in this case for girls aged 15 to 19 years old, risks are associated with more socioeconomic factors that with the biological effects of age. These factors are critical in fully understanding teenage pregnancy and for promotion of reproductive health among the adolescents. We also have educational attainment, poor educational background, living non relatives, risky sexual behaviors, perceived support from parents, poor knowledge of sexuality are risk factors to considering high rises of teenage pregnancy. We also have media exposure. It is important to note that media exposure is a complex issue also in Nigeria and can have both positive and negative impacts on adolescents. Or we have other family members. In this case, teen pregnancy and motherhood can influence younger siblings. One study found that the younger sister of a teen mother are highly we can say that are highly exposed to becoming pregnant because they'll follow the suit of what the sister went through. We have parental support in this case. It is important to note that parental support can play a protective role in reducing adolescent pregnancy. So if a parent does not support their children, they will be exposed to what to most of what is going on, rather causing teenage pregnancy. We also have peer pressure, peer pressure and media influence. Aside from sexual or rather, sexual related abuse studies have reported that peer pressure is a significant factor influencing adolescent pregnancy, more so in the parts of Nigeria. We also have sexual violence. Early sexual debut and being out of school are significantly associated with teenage pregnancies. Desire to compensate for the loss of a child, reduced access to information and contraception, and increased sexual violence. This really rather increases the high rise of teenage pregnancies. We have lack of sex education. Those who have received minimal education are five times more likely to become a mother than those with higher levels of education. We have lack of contraceptions, lack of reproductive health education, lack of parental control, family and peer pressure, poverty, love for material goods, misinformation and also lack of individual agency. Poverty, school dropout, lack of community support and limited access to contraception rather are some of the high causes of teenage pregnancies. We have poverty. Poverty. Besides the lack of contraceptives, adolescent pregnancies are also fueled by poverty. A poverty and dysfunctional family are implicated as influencing adolescent pregnancy. More so in Ghana, we have alcohol or drug use. In this case, inhibition reducing drugs and alcohol may possibly encourage unintended sexual activity causing teenage pregnancies. We also have early puberty alleviate. In this case, girls who mature early are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse at a younger age and this will end up causing high rise in teenage pregnancies. Wow. Thank you for that information. Number two, I read an article about the challenges that teen teenage mothers rather face. Have you or anyone you know experienced similar struggles as a young parent? Yes, someone very close indeed faced some of the struggles and I would like to highlight some of the struggles that I've seen teenage mothers go through. If you kindly allow me Mister Francis. Challenge number one, we have changes to mental health. Both becoming a teenage and pregnant are among the risk factors for depression. When these two factors are combined, the risk increases. Only ten to 15% of older mother experience prenatal and postpartum. This is after delivery depression and there are several causes for mental health changes in teenage mothers. One reason is that teen moms are more likely to experience pregnancy complications and this added rather adds stress to the teen mother. Teen parents do not have the time to devote to exercise, sleep and self care that they may have had before giving birth. Another challenge we have is the cost of raising a child. Infant care comes with large costs as we all know about time involved in feeding a baby takes a lot and consumes a lot. It's important to know the financial investment involved as well. If you use formula, for example, you'll have to budget for this expense. Baby food, which most children begin at six months, is another cost to consider. New moms have bottles, diapers, clothes, and toys to consider. In addition to healthcare costs, an infant requires larger ticket items such as a crib, high chair, changing table, and a stroller. We also have another challenge is difficulty juggling school with a child. School, as we all know, is time consuming. High school students in most schools, they spend roughly 7 hours a day. Even more high school teachers nationwide assign three, let's say 3.5 hours of work, that is, assignments on average. That means that students taking five academic classes have roughly 10 hours of school related work each day. Of course, this number doesn't include time for other essential tasks like getting ready for the day and traveling to and from school. Taking care of an infant is time consuming as well. The average infant nurses eight to twelve times a day for 20 to 45 minutes. That's over 2 hours spent feeding each day. In addition, new mothers report exhaustion from waking up multiple times each night, changing, bathing the baby, playing with the child, all take significant time as well. With all these activities, most new moms have difficulty concentrating and finding time to rest, let alone do their homework. Another challenge we have is poverty. Teen mothers suffer from poverty. They resort to transactional sex or endure gender violence and abuse in exchange for material goods, food or money. Many of these young girls, they are younger than the fathers of their babies. Thus a huge power imbalance, making it difficult for poor teenage mothers to defend and protect themselves from abusers. Some end up opting for early marriages, a way of assessing food, clothing, housing and security, which is very sad. Mental health problems I'll have to repeat on this and explain more. We have several factors that can negatively affect her teens mother's mental health. These include lack of sufficient sleep, lack of family support, especially in cases where pregnant teens are kicked out of parents or guardians' home, change in social status, loss of friends, the cost of raising a child, and the hassle of juggling school or raising a child. This and others can lead to mental health problems, including stress and depression. We have the possibility of family conflict. Telling your parents that you are pregnant isn't easy at all. Many parents are understandably upset when they learn that their child is pregnant. In the worst case scenario, parents have kicked their pregnant daughters out of the house without any support. We also have change in social status. Teen mothers often experienced a vast change in their social lives. Some drop out of schools to devote time to raising their children. Others may stay in school but must drop extracurricular activities to find a job to support their child's needs. All of these courses are disconnected from previous social circles and some girls report that friends maintain contact in the beginning, but their friendship change as the new mother's focus changes. There are a lot of them, but I don't know if time allows us to continue with some. Maybe I can read one more whereby they lose opportunity to advance education. Girls lose their childhood and are forced to drop the education to adapt to the life of caring for their children whereby you see in Kenya, 98% of teen mothers are out of school with a zero probability of returning. We have stigma and rejection. Teen mothers face stigma from their parents, actually teachers, peers and society. This has made it difficult for teen moms to seek social and moral support and at times many are disowned by their parents or kicked out of home. This leaves them with more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation in their community. So let's show them love, support, care as many times as we can. Thank you very much Mister Francis. Thank you so much for that. That was so informative. At least we have known some of the challenges teen mothers face through when they get their kids in early age. Thank you for coming through and thank you for having you. I'm so much humbled for having your time actually. And let me say thank you once again.",my name is francis wondy and i consent to recording this conversation my name is miri mohake and i consent to recording this conversation miri mohake welcome to

to our first question did you hear about the recent raise in teenage pregnancies and that made me feel so heartbroken what could what do you think some of the causes of the high rise of teenage pregnancy when we have schools pregnant girls often drop out of schools limiting opportunities for future employment and perpetuating the cycle of poverty we also married adolescents in this case adolescent pregnancy can also have negative social and economic effect on girls their families and communities will be affected by this we have social economics in this case for girls aged fifteen to

rather some of the high causes of teenage pregnancies we have poverty poverty besides the lack of contraceptives adolescent pregnancies are also fuelled by poverty a poverty and dysfunctional family are implicated as influencing adolescent pregnancy more so in ghana we have alcohol or drug use in this case inhibition reducing drugs and alcohol may possibly encourage unintended sexual activity causing teenage pregnancies puberty in this case girls who mature are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse at a young age and this will end up causing high rise in teenage pregnancies wow thank you for that information number two i read an article about the challenges that teenage mothers rather face you or anyone you know experience similar struggles as a young parent someone very close indeed faced some of the struggles and i would like to highlight some of the struggles that i've seen teenage mothers go through if you kindly allow me mr francis challenge number one we have changes to mental health both becoming teenage and pregnant are among the risk factors for depression when these two factors are combined the risk increases only ten to fifteen per cent of older mother experience prenatal and postpartum this is after delivery depression and there are several causes for mental health changes in one reason is that teen moms are more likely to experience pregnancy complications and this rather adds stress to their teen mother teen parents do not have the time to devote to exercise sleep and self care that they may have before giving birth another challenge we have is the cost of raising a child infant care comes with large cost as we all know time involved in feeding a baby takes a lot and consumes a lot it's important to know the financial investment involved as well if you use formula for example you'll have to budget for this expense baby food which most children begin at six months is another cost to consider new moms have bottles diapers clothes and toys to consider in addition to health cost an infant requires larger ticket items such as a crib high chair changing table and a stroller we also have another challenge is difficulty juggling school with a child school as we all know is time consuming high school in most schools they spend roughly seven hours a day even more high school teachers nationwide assign three let's say three five hours of work that is assignment on average that means that students taking five academic classes have roughly ten hours of school related work each day of course this number doesn't include time for other essential tasks like getting ready for the day and traveling to and from school taking care of an infant is time consuming as well the average infant eight to twelve times a day for twenty to forty five minutes that's over two hours spent feeding each day in addition new mothers report exhaustion from waking up multiple times each night changing bathing the baby playing with the child all take time as well with all these activities most new moms have difficulty concentrating in finding time to rest let alone do their homework another challenge we have is poverty teen mothers suffer from poverty they resort to transactional sex or enjoy gender violence in exchange for material goods food or money many of these young girls they are younger than the fathers of their babies thus a huge power imbalance making it difficult for poor teenage mothers to defend and protect themselves from abuses some end up opting for marriages in food clothing housing and security which is very sad mental health problems i'll have to repeat on this and explain more we have several factors that can negatively affect mother's mental health this include lack of sufficient sleep lack of family support especially in cases where pregnant teens are kicked out of parents or guardian's home changing social status loss of friends the cost of raising a child and the hassle of juggling school her raising a child this and others can lead to mental health problems including stress and depression we have the possibility of family conflict telling your parents that you're pregnant isn't easy at all many parents are understandably upset when they learn that their child is pregnant in the worst case scenario parents have their pregnant daughters out of the house without any support we also have change in social status teen mothers often experience a vast change in their social lives some drop out of schools to devote time to raising their children others may stay in school drop extra curricular activities to find a job to support the child's needs all of these causes a disconnect from previous social circles and some girls report that friends maintain contact in the beginning but their friendship change as the new mother's forecast changes there are lot of them but i don't know if time allows us to continue with some maybe i can read one more whereby they lose opportunity to advance education girls lose their childhood and are forced to drop the education to adapt to the life of caring for their children whereby you see in kenya ninety per cent of teen mothers are out of school with zero probability of returning we have stigma and rejection teen mothers face stigma from their parents actually teachers peers and society this has made it difficult for teen moms to seek social and moral support and at times dishonored by the appearance or kicked out of home this leaves them with more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation in their community so let's show them love support as many times as we can thank you very much mister francis thank you so much for that that was so informative at least we have known some of the challenges teen mothers face

through and thank you for having you i'm so much humbled for having your time actually and let me say thank you once again,"my name is francis wundi and i consent to recording this conversation. my name is mary muihaki and i consent to recording this conversation. mary muihaki, welcome to our today's program. i'm so much humbled to be with you on board today. okay, today we are discussing about teenage pregnancy. kindly let us know what is teenage pregnancy? thank you very much and i will give a brief of what is teenage pregnancy? according to my understanding now, teenage pregnancy refers to the situation in which a girl aged between 13 and 19 becomes pregnant. it is a global issue that affects not only the pregnant girl but also her family as well as the community. teenage pregnancy can have negative consequences for both the mother and child, including health risks, socio stigmatization and barrier to education and employment opportunities. addressing this issue requires comprehensive sex education, access to reproductive healthcare and support for young parents. wow. thank you for that brief explanation. and to our first question, did you hear about the recent rise in teenage pregnancies? yes, and that made me feel so heartbroken. what do you think could be the reason behind it? now some of the causes of the high rise of the teenage pregnancy when we have school dropouts, pregnant girls often drop out of schools, limiting opportunities for future employment and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. now we also have married adolescents. in this case, adolescent pregnancy can also have negative social and economic effects on girls. their families and communities will be affected by this. we have socioeconomics, in this case for girls aged 15 to 19 years old, risks are associated with more socioeconomic factors that with the biological effects of age. these factors are critical in fully understanding teenage pregnancy and for promotion of reproductive health among the adolescents. we also have educational attainment, poor educational background, living non relatives, risky sexual behaviors, perceived support from parents, poor knowledge of sexuality are risk factors to considering high rises of teenage pregnancy. we also have media exposure. it is important to note that media exposure is a complex issue also in nigeria and can have both positive and negative impacts on adolescents. or we have other family members. in this case, teen pregnancy and motherhood can influence younger siblings. one study found that the younger sister of a teen mother are highly we can say that are highly exposed to becoming pregnant because they'll follow the suit of what the sister went through. we have parental support in this case. it is important to note that parental support can play a protective role in reducing adolescent pregnancy. so if a parent does not support their children, they will be exposed to what to most of what is going on, rather causing teenage pregnancy. we also have peer pressure, peer pressure and media influence. aside from sexual or rather, sexual related abuse studies have reported that peer pressure is a significant factor influencing adolescent pregnancy, more so in the parts of nigeria. we also have sexual violence. early sexual debut and being out of school are significantly associated with teenage pregnancies. desire to compensate for the loss of a child, reduced access to information and contraception, and increased sexual violence. this really rather increases the high rise of teenage pregnancies. we have lack of sex education. those who have received minimal education are five times more likely to become a mother than those with higher levels of education. we have lack of contraceptions, lack of reproductive health education, lack of parental control, family and peer pressure, poverty, love for material goods, misinformation and also lack of individual agency. poverty, school dropout, lack of community support and limited access to contraception rather are some of the high causes of teenage pregnancies. we have poverty. poverty. besides the lack of contraceptives, adolescent pregnancies are also fueled by poverty. a poverty and dysfunctional family are implicated as influencing adolescent pregnancy. more so in ghana, we have alcohol or drug use. in this case, inhibition reducing drugs and alcohol may possibly encourage unintended sexual activity causing teenage pregnancies. we also have early puberty alleviate. in this case, girls who mature early are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse at a younger age and this will end up causing high rise in teenage pregnancies. wow. thank you for that information. number two, i read an article about the challenges that teen teenage mothers rather face. have you or anyone you know experienced similar struggles as a young parent? yes, someone very close indeed faced some of the struggles and i would like to highlight some of the struggles that i've seen teenage mothers go through. if you kindly allow me mister francis. challenge number one, we have changes to mental health. both becoming a teenage and pregnant are among the risk factors for depression. when these two factors are combined, the risk increases. only ten to 15% of older mother experience prenatal and postpartum. this is after delivery depression and there are several causes for mental health changes in teenage mothers. one reason is that teen moms are more likely to experience pregnancy complications and this added rather adds stress to the teen mother. teen parents do not have the time to devote to exercise, sleep and self care that they may have had before giving birth. another challenge we have is the cost of raising a child. infant care comes with large costs as we all know about time involved in feeding a baby takes a lot and consumes a lot. it's important to know the financial investment involved as well. if you use formula, for example, you'll have to budget for this expense. baby food, which most children begin at six months, is another cost to consider. new moms have bottles, diapers, clothes, and toys to consider. in addition to healthcare costs, an infant requires larger ticket items such as a crib, high chair, changing table, and a stroller. we also have another challenge is difficulty juggling school with a child. school, as we all know, is time consuming. high school students in most schools, they spend roughly 7 hours a day. even more high school teachers nationwide assign three, let's say 3.5 hours of work, that is, assignments on average. that means that students taking five academic classes have roughly 10 hours of school related work each day. of course, this number doesn't include time for other essential tasks like getting ready for the day and traveling to and from school. taking care of an infant is time consuming as well. the average infant nurses eight to twelve times a day for 20 to 45 minutes. that's over 2 hours spent feeding each day. in addition, new mothers report exhaustion from waking up multiple times each night, changing, bathing the baby, playing with the child, all take significant time as well. with all these activities, most new moms have difficulty concentrating and finding time to rest, let alone do their homework. another challenge we have is poverty. teen mothers suffer from poverty. they resort to transactional sex or endure gender violence and abuse in exchange for material goods, food or money. many of these young girls, they are younger than the fathers of their babies. thus a huge power imbalance, making it difficult for poor teenage mothers to defend and protect themselves from abusers. some end up opting for early marriages, a way of assessing food, clothing, housing and security, which is very sad. mental health problems i'll have to repeat on this and explain more. we have several factors that can negatively affect her teens mother's mental health. these include lack of sufficient sleep, lack of family support, especially in cases where pregnant teens are kicked out of parents or guardians' home, change in social status, loss of friends, the cost of raising a child, and the hassle of juggling school or raising a child. this and others can lead to mental health problems, including stress and depression. we have the possibility of family conflict. telling your parents that you are pregnant isn't easy at all. many parents are understandably upset when they learn that their child is pregnant. in the worst case scenario, parents have kicked their pregnant daughters out of the house without any support. we also have change in social status. teen mothers often experienced a vast change in their social lives. some drop out of schools to devote time to raising their children. others may stay in school but must drop extracurricular activities to find a job to support their child's needs. all of these courses are disconnected from previous social circles and some girls report that friends maintain contact in the beginning, but their friendship change as the new mother's focus changes. there are a lot of them, but i don't know if time allows us to continue with some. maybe i can read one more whereby they lose opportunity to advance education. girls lose their childhood and are forced to drop the education to adapt to the life of caring for their children whereby you see in kenya, 98% of teen mothers are out of school with a zero probability of returning. we have stigma and rejection. teen mothers face stigma from their parents, actually teachers, peers and society. this has made it difficult for teen moms to seek social and moral support and at times many are disowned by their parents or kicked out of home. this leaves them with more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation in their community. so let's show them love, support, care as many times as we can. thank you very much mister francis. thank you so much for that. that was so informative. at least we have known some of the challenges teen mothers face through when they get their kids in early age. thank you for coming through and thank you for having you. i'm so much humbled for having your time actually. and let me say thank you once again.",0.1998810232004759,my name is francis wondy and

to transactional sex or endure gender violence and abuse in exchange for material goods food or money many of these young girls they are younger than the fathers of their babies thus a huge power imbalance making it difficult for poor teenage mothers to defend and protect themselves from abusers some end up opting for early marriages a way of assessing food clothing housing and security which is very sad mental health problems i will have to repeat on this and explain more we have several factors that can negatively affect her teens mother is mental health these include lack of sufficient sleep lack of family support especially in cases where pregnant teens are kicked out of parents or guardians home change in social status loss of friends the cost of raising a child and the hassle of juggling school or raising a child this and others can lead to mental health problems including stress and depression we have the possibility of family conflict telling your parents that you are pregnant is not easy at all many parents are understandably upset when they learn that their child is pregnant in the worst case scenario parents have kicked their pregnant daughters out of the house without any support we also have change in social status teen mothers often experienced a vast change in their social lives some drop out of schools to devote time to raising their children others may stay in school but must drop extracurricular activities to find a job to support their child is needs all of these courses are disconnected from previous social circles and some girls report that friends maintain contact in the beginning but their friendship change as the new mother is focus changes there are a lot of them but i do not know if time allows us to continue with some maybe i can read one more whereby they lose opportunity to advance education girls lose their childhood and are forced to drop the education to adapt to the life of caring for their children whereby you see in kenya 98% of teen mothers are out of school with a 0 probability of returning we have stigma and rejection teen mothers face stigma from their parents actually teachers peers and society this has made it difficult for teen moms to seek social and moral support and at times many are disowned by their parents or kicked out of home this leaves them with more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation in their community so let us show them love support care as many times as we can thank you very much mister francis thank you so much for that that was so informative at least we have known some of the challenges teen mothers face through when they get their kids in early age thank you for coming through and thank you for having you i am so much humbled for having your time actually and let me say thank you once again

My name is Mpomufu gang and I give consent to recording this conversation. My name is Saufugeng and I give consent to recording this conversation. Alright, so our topic for today is technology. Does it bring people together? Does it bring people closer or does it drive them? Apartheid? What's your take on that? This is a very tricky one because in my opinion, technology bring people together and it also drives them apart. But in this instance, I would say that it's bringing people together. I disagree. The majority of the technology, mostly it like drives people apart. You think so? Yes. All right, so the main reason that I'm saying that it's bringing people closer. Would be. The source of communication. Right? So we are able to communicate with our loved ones, even though they are across borders, they are in other countries, they are not close to us, but we are able to get in touch with them. And it's because of technology that is possible, you know? So why would you think that it's driving people apart? It goes both ways, actually. It does. But the majority, I would say, drives people apart because, like, there's a lot of negativity in social media. Yeah, because social media is also a part of technology. It drives people apart because, like, example, if you post something and like, people are good in your comment and violate you, say bad things about you, bully you. Cyberbullying just because. Yeah, cyberbullying. And it will get you like self esteem down. Yeah. And for people, you know, like, like personally, you would like, they would like sometimes like expose you for things that shouldn't be known. And most of the times you would like, cut those people off. That's why it's driving them apart. That's why. Yeah, you, you have a point there. You know, the other day I was actually, I saw this post on Facebook. Right? Yes. So there was this, there was a Snapchat of this lady and a guy. So they were holding hands in the mall, you know, but the caption was like, you know what? This guy is a married man, so he was actually cheating on his wife. You know, so it's actually a bad impact because, all right. It is a good thing that a woman finally knows the wife found out. And knows the truth. Yeah. What her husband was actually up to all this time. But the thing is, it's going to hurt her. She's going to hurt to. That's why I say it's driving them apart. Yes. And in a case of children, social. Media, you know, they will get bullied. You know, when once something is actually there on social media, it is there forever. Forever. If you go after 15 years and search for it still there, you're going to find it, you know? But then I heard that if you want to take something down on social media or on a website, it cost you a lot of cash. Have you heard of them? Even if you do take it down, people who know. Yeah. Will, like, bully you. They still know. That doesn't mean when it. When the video or anything, it's taken. It's taken. It's taken down on the. Yeah, social media, it's not taken down on people's, like, brains. They remember it. Google is actually spying on us. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. So I also feel sorry for the kids, you know, to. Because they're gonna get bullied at school and, yeah, it's driving them apart in some way, you know. So in a case of schools, would you say that technology has brought people together or driven them apartheid schools premises? I don't know about that, because, like, in our school, we don't use. Actually, we don't use phones. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, we only use books, but for other, like, schools where they use, like, technology, like laptops, it's. It's, it's. It's a good thing because, like, the books are heavy. Books are heavy. So having to carry, like, um, just laptop and it has all the textbooks you need to have is actually a good thing. It's a good thing, yeah. All right, so in the ongoing debate about the impact of technology on human relationships, the questions arises. You know, this question, this topic that we actually talking about, it arises. Lot of time, you know, I've been hearing it about. I've been hearing about it for the longest time. So I also feel that it brings us together because I can actually work from home, you know, with my laptop, not being there by the office. I can talk to my colleagues and interact with them and also with clients, you know, if I need to talk with them regarding our work and stuff. And technology is addictive, so it drives people, um, drives people away, like, they don't from themselves mental states and friends, because, like, most. Most people would rather, like, go. Go on their phone and scroll on TikTok, social media, score anything, and not go with their friends and, like, having, like, you know. Yeah. So, like, in this case, we didn't actually disagree with each other that much. We actually agree with each other because it goes both ways, you know? So I would say that it has the capacity to both bring people close together and create distance, depending on how it is utilized. Utilized. You know, by leveraging digital tools, you know, thoughtfully and managing screen time and in person interactions, you know, people can. Benefit from technology, can harness the benefits. Yeah, they can. While preserving the richness of personal connections. We actually shouldn't forget that we actually need each other more than we need technology know. But it's also, it's, it's actually always nice to go paperless. As you said, books are heavy. And, you know, what I like about computers, or rather laptops is that you can create your file, you can create your file and your documents and you can file your documents nicely in your, in your folders, in your computer, alphabetically. So whenever you need documents. Yes. It's easier, it's easier to go there. Than carrying loads of weight. Yeah. Yes. So other than that, I feel that we, and, you know, and white light. We need lightest technology. Yeah, lightest technology. Light bulbs. Yeah, yeah. To cook, we need technology. Yeah. We need stoves. You know, so it actually has a good, like, it goes both sides. Yeah. But when coming to a point of machinery innovation, I feel that most people. Loses their job because of their job, because of technology. Yeah, yeah. Though, um, technology actually that advances and they make robots so they cannot pay like, people. They cannot pay people. And, uh, the robots are actually most efficient and give out better results. But it's not, it's, yeah, not a. Good thing on, like, for the companies. A good, it's a good thing because, like, they don't get delayed because of people. Because some people can have a limit of, like, physical labor. Yeah. So, like, the world do not get, like, don't have like, day off day. I do get that it's an ongoing thing, productivity. But then when it, when it comes, yeah, when it comes to maybe do they service robots, those robots or whatever, how do they, like, do they maintain them? Maintenance, my guy. Like, I feel that they, they do need maintenance because you can't, you can't, you can't work every day without maintenance. You know, it's like a car. You need to service your car after a certain time of, period of time. Yes. You need to service it. You need to service like, everything. Even your laptop, your computer, you, laptop, you, you need to service them. Yeah. So I don't know. But then, you know what? I'll research about that if robots are actually being maintained or what. So in concluding everything, I feel that today's topic was very educative to me. Yeah, it was very educative to me because we actually don't, we actually take things, like, for granted. For granted. But I also feel that, you know, what? What do you feel about google? Google? I feel. I feel like it's a good thing. Yeah. It has this downside. Downside body. But mostly. Mostly it's a good thing because, like, you could just google something if, like, you need something, like, work related. Just go to google quick search, get what you want. Or maybe if you're busy with a. Rather than. Rather than going to a book, reading everything. Yeah. Going to libraries, you have Google fast. Yeah. Or maybe when you. Maybe when you're busy with your book and then you come across this road that you really do not understand, so you kind of. It's just quick to go to Google rather than to fetch a dictionary and go search for the word. I feel like a lot of. Yeah. Some people may not feel the same way that we do, but I feel that, you know, and there are a lot of things that, you know, we can teach our toddlers. There are a lot of videos that we get on phones, social media about, you know, learning them side words, learning them, the sounds of. Of every Alphabet and stuff, making it creative, you know? So I think that it is a. It is bringing people together because, I mean, do you watch cocomelon? Yeah. Because immediately, when your toddlers acting upon you, you immediately turn on the cocomelo on your smart tv. It's actually technology. And then he or she becomes pleasant, happy with you and stuff. So it brought you together, and they become smart. Those shows, like, give. Give out education. Yeah. But then I also heard that we should actually choose which shows should they watch. Yeah, because there are some. That's what I'm saying. There are some good things. There's some bad things. There's some, like, kid things you don't know that, like, um, has a better gender. Yeah. Like, your kids. So your kids are not gonna grow up. Like, how. They're actually gonna actually have to. Yes. But the good side is they know. They. They get to know a lot of things. They get to know how to, like, talk to people because, like, they remember. Oh, I remember this. I remember this. So, yeah, technology is a. I once saw this. This video on TikTok. This guy was actually trashing Peppa pig. Do you know Peppa pig? Yes, peppa pig. He was actually trashing it, saying that we shouldn't let kids watch Peppa Pig because she's actually rude and she's so controlling, you know? And then one time, I took time to actually watch it because my son watches it. He loves it. Yes. So I actually took time to watch it, right? So while I was busy watching it, what he said and comparing to what I see to what I saw at that moment was actually two different things. You know, I saw pepper conducting good manners for his. For her brother George, you know? Now let's wrap it up. In conclusion, technology has good and bad things, so you just gotta drive them. Apartheid.",all right my name is pommufoo gang and i give consent to recording this conversation my name is homufoo gang and i give consent to recording this conversation all right so our topic for today is technology does it bring people together does it bring people closer or does it drive them apart what do you take on that this is a very tricky one because in my opinion technology brings people together and it also drives them apart but in this instance i think that it's bringing people together i disagree the majority of technology mostly drives people apart you think so all right so the reason that i'm saying that is bringing people closer would be the source of communication we are able to communicate with our loved ones even though they are cross us other countries they are not close to us but we are able to get in touch with them and it's because of technology that is possible you know so why would you think that it's driving people up it goes both ways actually it does it but the majority i would say drives people apart because like there's a lot of negativity in especially social media yeah because social media is also part of technology address apart because example you post something and like people are good in your comment and violate you say bad things about you believe cyber bullying just because self esteem down and for people you know like person you would like though would like sometimes like expose you things that shouldn't be known and most of the times you would like cut those people of that's why it's driving them up that's why i say you have a plane you know the other day i saw this post on facebook right there was a snapshot of this lady and a guy so they were holding hands in the mall you know but the caption was like you know what this guy is a married man so he was actually cheating on his wife you so it's actually a bit in pain because all right it isn't that a woman finally knows the truth yeah what was her husband was actually up to all this time but the thing it's it's going to hurt her she's going to hurt to usage having them apart years in the case of children social media you know don't get bullied you know when once something is actually their own social media it is there for forever if you go after fifteen years and search for it you're going to find it you know but then i heard that if you want to take something down on social media or website it cost you a lot of kids every heard of there really if you do take it down people they still know that doesn't mean when it when the video or anything it's taken down it's taken down on the yeah social media it's not taken down on people's life they remember it google is actually spying on us i'm telling you i'm telling you so i also feel sorry for the kids you know too because they're gonna get bullied at school and yeah it's driving them apart in in some way you know so in a case of schools which say that technology has brought people together given them apart at schools i don't know about that because like in our school we don't use actually you don't use phones so we only use books for but for other like schools where they use like technology like laptops it's a good thing because books i have books i have you so having to carry just laptop and it has all the textbooks you need to have actually a all right so in the ongoing debates about the impact of technology on human relationships the questions you know this question this topic that we actually talking about a lot of time you know i've been hearing it about been hearing about it for the longest time so i also feel that brings us together because i can actually work from home you know with my not being there by the office i can talk to my colleagues and interact with them and also with clients you know if i need talk with them regarding our work and stuff and technology is addictive people to drive people away from themselves and friends because like most most people would rather like go on their phone and take social media school anything and not go with their friends and like having like you know so like in this case we didn't actually disagree with each other with each other cause it goes both ways you know so i would say that it has to both bring people close together and create these days depending on how it is utilized to live you know digital tools you know thoughtfully managing screen time in person in turn you know people can benefit from technology while preserving the richness of personal we actually shouldn't forget that we actually need each other need you know but it's also it's actually always nice to go paperless as you said books i hear and you know what i like about computers is that you can create your five you create your file and your documents and you can find your documents nails in your in your folders in your computer alphabetically so whenever you need to easier to go then so other than that i feel that we and you know and why we need light distinct yeah let's just take a little light bulbs to cook we need to take we need stove you know but when you come into a plant of machinery innovation i feel that most people lose their job because technology actually like advances and they make robots so they cannot pay like people they can pay and uh the robots are actually more efficient and give out better results because like for the companies a good it's a good thing because like they don't get delayed because of people because some people can't have a limit of like physical labor yeah so like the the world do not get don't have like day off you get that is an ongoing thing productivity but then when you when it comes when it comes to maybe to this service rubel's those who will to what do they maintain their maintenance like i feel that they do need maintenance cause you can't you can't you can't work every day without maintenance you know it's like a car you need to service your car certain time of period of time yes service it you need to service like everything even your laptop your computer your laptop you need to service them ya so i don't know but then you know what i'll i'll research about that if robots are actually being maintained or what so in concluding everything i feel that today's topic was very educative to me it was very educated to me because we actually don't we actually take things light for granted for granted but i also feel that you know what do you feel about google google i feel i feel like it's a good thing and has downside but mostly

videos that we get on phones social media about you know learning them side words learning them the alphabet and stuff creative you know so i think that it is it is bringing people together because i mean do you watch coca miller because when you toddler's acting upon you you immediately turn on the cocoa on the smart tv to actually take melogi and then he or she becomes pleasant hip with you and stuff so together and they those shows like give out education but then i also heard that we should actually choose which shows should be because there are some that's why i'm saying there's some good things there's some things there's some like things you don't know that like has a better gender kids and i'm going to coop like how they're actually going to actually have so but the good side is they know they get to know a lot of things they get to know how to like talk to people because i remember oh i remember this i technology is i once saw this this video on t talk this guy was actually pepper pick do you know pepper peak pepper peak he was actually trashing it saying that i wish to let kids watch pepper peak because she's actually you know and then one time i took time to actually watch it because my son which is a t v loves it years so i actually took time to watch it right so while i was busy watching it while he said comparing to what i see where there's so at that moment

so they were holding hands in the mall, you know, but the caption was like, you know what? this guy is a married man, so he was actually cheating on his wife. you know, so it's actually a bad impact

on social media, it is there forever. forever. if you go after 15 years and search for it still there, you're going to find it, you know? but then i heard that if you want to take something down on

schools, would you say that technology has brought people together or driven them apartheid schools premises? i don't know about that, because, like, in our school, we don't use. actually, we don't use phones. yeah. yeah. so, yeah, we only use books, but for other, like, schools where they use, like, technology, like laptops, it's. it's, it's. it's a good thing because, like, the books are heavy. books are heavy. so having to carry, like, um, just laptop and it has all the textbooks you need to have is actually a good thing. it's a good thing, yeah. all right, so in the ongoing debate about the impact of technology on human relationships, the questions arises. you know, this question, this topic that we actually talking about, it arises. lot of time, you know, i've been hearing it about. i've been hearing about it for the longest time. so i also feel that it brings us together because i can actually work from home, you know, with my laptop, not being there by the office. i can talk to my colleagues and interact with them and also with clients, you know, if i need to talk with them regarding our work and stuff. and technology is addictive, so it drives people, um, drives people away, like, they don't from themselves mental states and friends, because, like, most. most people would rather, like, go. go on their phone and scroll on tiktok, social media, score anything, and not go with their friends and, like, having, like, you know. yeah. so, like, in this case, we didn't actually disagree with each other that much. we actually agree with each other because it goes both ways, you know? so i would say that it has the capacity to both bring people close together and create distance, depending on how it is utilized. utilized. you know, by leveraging digital tools, you know, thoughtfully and managing screen time and in person interactions, you know, people can. benefit from technology, can harness the benefits. yeah, they can. while preserving the richness of personal connections. we actually shouldn't forget that we actually need each other more than we need technology know. but it's also, it's, it's actually always nice to go paperless. as you said, books are heavy. and, you know, what i like about computers, or rather laptops is that you can create your file, you can create your file and your documents and you can file your documents nicely in your, in your folders, in your computer, alphabetically. so whenever you need documents. yes. it's easier, it's easier to go there. than carrying loads of weight. yeah. yes. so other than that, i feel that we, and, you know, and white light. we need lightest technology. yeah, lightest technology. light bulbs. yeah, yeah. to cook, we need technology. yeah. we need stoves. you know, so it actually has a good, like, it goes both sides. yeah. but when coming to a point of machinery innovation, i feel that most people. loses their job because of their job, because of technology. yeah, yeah. though, um, technology actually that advances and they make robots so they cannot pay like, people. they cannot pay people. and, the robots are actually most efficient and give out better results. but it's not, it's, yeah, not a. good thing on, like, for the companies. a good, it's a good thing because, like, they don't get delayed because of people. because some people can have a limit of, like, physical labor. yeah. so, like, the world do not get, like, don't have like, day off day. i do get that it's an ongoing thing, productivity. but then when it, when it comes, yeah, when it comes to maybe do they service robots, those robots or whatever, how do they, like, do they maintain them? maintenance, my guy. like, i feel that they, they do need maintenance because you can't, you can't, you can't work every day without maintenance. you know, it's like a car. you need to service your car after a certain time of, period of time. yes. you need to service it. you need to service like, everything. even your laptop, your computer, you, laptop, you, you need to service them. yeah. so i don't know. but then, you know what? i'll research about that if robots are actually being maintained or what. so in concluding everything, i feel that today's topic was very educative to me. yeah, it was very educative to me because we actually don't, we actually take things, like, for granted. for granted. but i also feel that, you know, what? what do you feel about google? google? i feel. i feel like it's a good thing. yeah. it has this downside. downside body. but mostly. mostly it's a good thing because, like, you could just google something if, like, you need something, like, work related. just go to google quick search, get what you want. or maybe if you're busy with a. rather than. rather than going to a book, reading everything. yeah. going to libraries, you have google fast. yeah. or maybe when you. maybe when you're busy with your book and then you come across this road that you really do not understand, so you kind of. it's just quick to go to google rather than to fetch a dictionary and go search for the word. i feel like a lot of. yeah. some people may not feel the same way that we do, but i feel that, you know, and there are a lot of things that, you know, we can teach our toddlers. there are a lot of videos that we get on phones, social media about, you know, learning them side words, learning them, the sounds of. of every alphabet and stuff, making it creative, you know? so i think that it is a. it is bringing people together because, i mean, do you watch cocomelon? yeah. because immediately, when your toddlers acting upon you, you immediately turn on the cocomelo on your smart tv. it's actually technology. and then he or she becomes pleasant, happy with you and stuff. so it brought you together, and they become smart. those shows, like, give. give out education. yeah. but then i also heard that we should actually choose which shows should they watch. yeah, because there are some. that's what i'm saying. there are some good things. there's some bad things. there's some, like, kid things you don't know that, like, um, has a better gender. yeah. like, your kids. so your kids are not gonna grow up. like, how. they're actually gonna actually have to. yes. but the good side is they know. they. they get to know a lot of things. they get to know how to, like, talk to people because, like, they remember. oh, i remember this. i remember this. so, yeah, technology is a. i once saw this. this video on tiktok. this guy was actually trashing peppa pig. do you know peppa pig? yes, peppa pig. he was actually trashing it, saying that we shouldn't let kids watch peppa pig because she's actually rude and she's so controlling, you know? and then one time, i took time to actually watch it because my son watches it. he loves it. yes. so i actually took time to watch it, right? so while i was busy watching it, what he said and comparing to what i see to what i saw at that moment was actually two different things. you know, i saw pepper conducting good manners for his. for her brother george, you know? now let's wrap it up. in conclusion, technology has good and bad things, so you just gotta drive them. apartheid.",0.40198640878201775,all right my name is pommufoo gang and i give consent to recording this conversation my name is homufoo gang and i give consent to recording this conversation all right so our topic for today is technology does it bring people together does it bring people closer or does it drive them apart what do you take on that this is a very tricky one because in my opinion technology brings people together and it also drives them apart but in this instance i think that it is bringing people together i disagree the majority of technology mostly drives people apart you think so all right so the reason that i am saying that is bringing people closer would be the source of communication we are able to communicate with our loved ones even though they are cross us other countries they are not close to us but we are able to get in touch with them and it is because of technology that is possible you know so why would you think that it is driving people up it goes both ways actually it does it but the majority i would say drives people apart because like there is a lot of negativity in especially social media yeah because social media is also part of technology address apart because example you post something and like people are good in your comment and violate you say bad things about you believe cyber bullying just because self esteem down and for people you know like person you would like though would like sometimes like expose you things that should not be known and most of the times you would like cut those people of that is why it is driving them up that is why i say you have a plane you know the other day i saw this post on facebook right there was a snapshot of this lady and a guy so they were holding hands in the mall you know but the caption was like you know what this guy is a married man so he was actually cheating on his wife you so it is actually a bit in pain because all right it is not that a woman finally knows the truth yeah what was her husband was actually up to all this time but the thing it is it is going to hurt her she is going to hurt to usage having them apart years in the case of children social media you know do not get bullied you know when once something is actually their own social media it is there for forever if you go after 15 years and search for it you are going to find it you know but then i heard that if you want to take something down on social media or website it cost you a lot of kids every heard of there really if you do take it down people they still know that does not mean when it when the video or anything it is taken down it is taken down on the yeah social media it is not taken down on people is life they remember it google is actually spying on us i am telling you i am telling you so i also feel sorry for the kids you know too because they are going to get bullied at school and yeah it is driving them apart in in some way you know so in a case of schools which say that technology has brought people together given them apart at schools i do not know about that because like in our school we do not use actually you do not use phones so we only use books for but for other like schools where they use like technology like laptops it is a good thing because books i have books i have you so having to carry just laptop and it has all the textbooks you need to have actually a all right so in the ongoing debates about the impact of technology on human relationships the questions you know this question this topic that we actually talking about a lot of time you know i have been hearing it about been hearing about it for the longest time so i also feel that brings us together because i can actually work from home you know with my not being there by the office i can talk to my colleagues and interact with them and also with clients you know if i need talk with them regarding our work and stuff and technology is addictive people to drive people away from themselves and friends because like most most people would rather like go on their phone and take social media school anything and not go with their friends and like having like you know so like in this case we did not actually disagree with each other with each other cause it goes both ways you know so i would say that it has to both bring people close together and create these days depending on how it is utilized to live you know digital tools you know thoughtfully managing screen time in person in turn you know people can benefit from technology while preserving the richness of personal we actually should not forget that we actually need each other need you know but it is also it is actually always nice to go paperless as you said books i hear and you know what i like about computers is that you can create your 5 you create your file and your documents and you can find your documents nails in your in your folders in your computer alphabetically so whenever you need to easier to go then so other than that i feel that we and you know and why we need light distinct yeah let us just take a little light bulbs to cook we need to take we need stove you know but when you come into a plant of machinery innovation i feel that most people lose their job because technology actually like advances and they make robots so they cannot pay like people they can pay and the robots are actually more efficient and give out better results because like for the companies a good it is a good thing because like they do not get delayed because of people because some people can not have a limit of like physical labor yeah so like the the world do not get do not have like day off you get that is an ongoing thing productivity but then when you when it comes when it comes to maybe to this service rubel is those who will to what do they maintain their maintenance like i feel that they do need maintenance cause you can not you can not you can not work every day without maintenance you know it is like a car you need to service your car certain time of period of time yes service it you need to service like everything even your laptop your computer your laptop you need to service them ya so i do not know but then you know what i will i will research about that if robots are actually being maintained or what so in concluding everything i feel that today is topic was very educative to me it was very educated to me because we actually do not we actually take things light for granted for granted but i also feel that you know what do you feel about google google i feel i feel like it is a good thing and has downside but mostly mostly it is a good thing because you could just google something if like you need something like work related just go to google quick search what you want or maybe if you are busy with and rather than going to a book you have maybe when you maybe when you are busy with your book and then you come across this world that you need you to not understand so you can just quick to go rather than to fetch dictionary and go search for the word i it is not a lot of hassles a lot of some people may not do the same with you but i feel you know and there are a lot of things that you know toddlers a lot of videos that we get on phones social media about you know learning them side words learning them the alphabet and stuff creative you know so i think that it is it is bringing people together because i mean do you watch coca miller because when you toddler is acting upon you you immediately turn on the cocoa on the smart tv to actually take melogi and then he or she becomes pleasant hip with you and stuff so together and they those shows like give out education but then i also heard that we should actually choose which shows should be because there are some that is why i am saying there is some good things there is some things there is some like things you do not know that like has a better gender kids and i am going to coop like how they are actually going to actually have so but the good side is they know they get to know a lot of things they get to know how to like talk to people because i remember 0 i remember this i technology is i once saw this this video on t talk this guy was actually pepper pick do you know pepper peak pepper peak he was actually trashing it saying that i wish to let kids watch pepper peak because she is actually you know and then one time i took time to actually watch it because my son which is a t v loves it years so i actually took time to watch it right so while i was busy watching it while he said comparing to what i see where there is so at that moment was actually 2 different things you know i saw pepper conducting good manners for his for her brother george you know now let us wrap it up in conclusion technology has good and bad things got together and it drives them apart,alright my name is mpomufu gang and i give consent to recording this conversation my name is saufugeng and i give consent to recording this conversation alright so our topic for today is technology does it bring people together does it bring people closer or does it drive them apartheid what is your take on that this is a very tricky one because in my opinion technology bring people together and it also drives them apart but in this instance i would say that it is bringing people together i disagree the majority of the technology mostly it like drives people apart you think so yes all right so the main reason that i am saying that it is bringing people closer would be the source of communication right so we are able to communicate with our loved ones even though they are across borders they are in other countries they are not close to us but we are able to get in touch with them and it is because of technology that is possible you know so why would you think that it is driving people apart it goes both ways actually it does but the majority i would say drives people apart because like there is a lot of negativity in social media yeah because social media is also a part of technology it drives people apart because like example if you post something and like people are good in your comment and violate you say bad things about you bully you cyberbullying just because yeah cyberbullying and it will get you like self esteem down yeah and for people you know like like personally you would like they would like sometimes like expose you for things that should not be known and most of the times you would like cut those people off that is why it is driving them apart that is why yeah you you have a point there you know the other day i was actually i saw this post on facebook right yes so there was this there was a snapchat of this lady and a guy so they were holding hands in the mall you know but the caption was like you know what this guy is a married man so he was actually cheating on his wife you know so it is actually a bad impact because all right it is a good thing that a woman finally knows the wife found out and knows the truth yeah what her husband was actually up to all this time but the thing is it is going to hurt her she is going to hurt to that is why i say it is driving them apart yes and in a case of children social media you know they will get bullied you know when once something is actually there on social media it is there forever forever if you go after 15 years and search for it still there you are going to find it you know but then i

still know that does not mean when it when the video or anything it is taken it is taken it is taken down on the yeah social media it is not taken down on people is like brains they remember it google

My name is Liam Washira, and I consent to record in this conversation. Thank you very much, Mr Liam, for agreeing to be on board with us. You're welcome. On today's topic, we'll be discussing about racism. I have several questions to ask about it. Mr Liam, could you kindly tell us what is racism? Racism, to me, is discrimination or by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership or particular racial or ethnic group. And while we are still at it, have you ever personally experienced or witnessed racism? Yes, I have two cases where I witnessed or I was a victim of racism. Number one, I was reported by my neighbors who thought I was a thief just because of my color. When was and where was this? This happened in the United States of America. I had gone to stay with my cousin. I went there as a student. Yes. Number two, the other case happened at school where students used to bully me because of my color, because of my race. And it really was a bad incident. So sorry about that. And how did it make you feel? I felt that my self esteem had gone down. I was insecure. I was also. And I also became antisocial. I was traumatized. Yes. So, Mr Liam, I'm so sorry to hear about that and the experience that you went through. And do you think racism is still an issue in today's society? Yes, racism still is an issue in today's society because it affects so many people, and it also causes mostly self esteem and you lose, or it affects the abilities of yourself. And How do you think we can work towards eradicating it? Racism can be worked to be eradicated in several ways. You can learn to recognize and understand your own privileges. By this, you can be checking your own privileges and using your privileges to dismantle systematic racism by race. You can examine your own biases and consider where they may have originated. In that case. I mean, you ask yourself as a kid, what messages did you receive about other people who are different from you? You can also validate the experiences and feelings of people of color. By that, you can do by supporting the experiences and engaging in tough conversation about race and injustices. You can also challenge the colorblind ideology. You can also call out racist jokers or correct them and educate them. You can find out how your school or your company, which you work in, is expanded or has expanded opportunities for people of color. Thank you very much, Mr Washira, for your time. To make us understand more about racism. And I'm really sorry about the experience that you had in the US. And hopefully people understand more about racism and those that are in the forefront to make sure that people feel insecure the way you felt and antisocial the way you felt because of racism, they really stop about it. Thank you once again for agreeing to be on board with us. Thank you so much for inviting me. And thank you so much for sharing about racism.

My name is Liam Washira and I consent to record in this conversation. Thank you, Mister Liam, for agreeing to be with us on board today. You are welcome. I have some very few questions regarding friendship. Yes, you can continue. And before that, I would like you to define what is friendship? Friendship is a special and meaningful connection between two or more individuals that is based on mutual trusts, support and understanding. It is a bond that brings people together regardless of differences in background, beliefs or interests. And while we are still at it in the friendship topic, what qualities do you value most in a friend and why? But before we go to why so what qualities do you check in a friend? The qualities I check in a friend is one, loyalty. Two, honesty. Three, empathy. Four, respect. Five, if you are truthful. Six. You, good listener. Humor, patience, encouragement, positive attitude. And if you keep secrets, sincerity. Deep conversation. There are so many, many, many aspects. And I would like maybe you elaborate more on what is loyalty? What is honesty? Because I would like us to know more about this. Okay. Loyalty is about standing up for each other, being there in times of need, and never betraying trust. Yes. Number two, sincerity or honest? Let's start with honesty. Honesty is like. Let's say you've been loyal to each other without distortions. So a sincere friend doesn't sugarcoat the truth or hide behind fake compliments. You have to be transparent to build a good relationship. Empathy. We can say empathy is the ability to understand and share friends feeling. In putting yourself in shoes or I of offering support, empathetic friends make you feel or see or feel very safe to communicate. The other thing is respect. Respect is a nod to each other's opinion. It's just about being civil by showing appreciation. It's the secret uncheck in a friendship club where everyone feels valued. Yes, another aspect is. Another aspect is another. Yes. Another aspect is humor. You have a friend who is laughing and like having a personal stand up comedy on special dial. Patience. Someone. Someone who is patient. Patient is the willingness to pursue, oppose, reflect and give time to for clarity in a friendship. Patient also helps through rough patches. Just like the way you are loyal to your friend. Okay. Encouragement. A friend who likes to encourage you and to show you the positive side of life. Positive attitude. A positive attitude in a friend is like having someone who can tell you good things in future. Who can tell you the positive side of you in future according to the way he sees you. The passion you have, the things you have. Someone who can keep secret that's automatic elaborate. You can know how to hear and keep someone's secret. Yes. Okay. And when we are still at that, why would I find a friend who can keep secrets? Why would I have a friend who is sincere and have a positive attitude? Sorry, what I'm trying to say. We have discussed about the qualities that we can value most in a friend. Yes. And why would I value a friend who can keep secrets? Why would I value a friend who is sincere? Why would I value a friend who has a positive attitude towards me and a friend who can also encourage me? On why I need a friend who keeps secret is because if you have a friend, you need to share something which you are supposed to keep it as a secret or you are supposed to guard. It's good having a person who guards your private conversation like treasure and you cannot open up on that. On sincerity. You need someone who is honest, who is real, and a genuine person who you can count on. Positive attitude. You need someone who can tell you, who can show you the positive side of your attitude and can be able to guide you accordingly. Wow. Yes. And while we are still at it, as we wind up, can you share a funny or heartwarming memory with a close friend? Mister Liam? Yes, I can share a funny or heartwarming memory I've ever encountered. I was in a boys boarding school in class eight my final year. In my primary school here in Kenya, we had a parent's day and the same was announced and parents knew about it. So I was expecting my family to come on that event. And, you know, in Kenya, it's a culture when you have a. You have a parent's day, they come to school and they come carrying food. So on such days, the school does not provide food. They only cook normal food, but in small portion. So my parents never showed up. I even tried calling them, but my mom was not picking her phone, so the only number I had often was my mom's number. So I kept calling. The phone was not answered. So my friend came through by the name job. He was very, very, uh, patient with me. He tried to support him. Yeah, he was so supportive. He tried to ask me what was going on. I tried to explain to him that no one was coming. And, uh, I. I was really worried. He showed, uh, he was so, uh, he was so. He was so eager to listen to me and he showed me it was not an issue and we could share the things his parents had brought to him. Yes. So you ended up sharing. Yes. Family. Yes. I ended up sharing what they had carried. I ate all. The day was finally over. No one showed from my side. That would be very sad. But on the other side, a friend showed up. Yes. Wow. Thank you very much, Mr. Liam. Mr. Liam. That was so encouraging. That was so educative, and we are so grateful that we had you on board.

My name is Mpomufuken, and I consent to recording this conversation. My name is Tao Mufuken, and I consent to recording this conversation. All right, so our topic for today is, can celebrities make good politicians? No, they cannot. So you believe that they cannot? Yes, they cannot, because they don't have the experience that the politicians have. And they don't have, like, genuine interest in politics and are often against it and cannot make better decisions than the current ones. Okay than the current politicians. All right, so I do get your point, but I also believe that they can, you know, they can be politicians, because I believe that everybody should be given a chance. You know, when you're given a chance, that's why you will flourish in what you were given a chance to. You know, because they were also giving the, the musicians, they were given a chance to make music. So that's when they, they knew how to make music. They knew how to entertain people. That's when they had the influence on people. They entertain people, not set the rules. Yeah, I do. They are used to making the, the entertainment, not the rules. Like, then they cannot. Like, they don't have any experience. And it's hard for them. Like, because now they're older and. No, but I do believe that if they are given a chance, they can be politicians, you know, because what I know for a fact is that our, I won't say the names, but our previous presidents, some of them, I know two of them actually, that did not go to high school. They do not have high school until now. They don't have high school education. That's the thing. They don't have high school education. But that time when they didn't go to high school, what did they do? Go study law? Go study politics? Who, the politicians? Yeah. You know, what, to prepare. They had enough time to prepare, yes. But I also believe that celebrities can also have time to prepare to become politicians. You know, because I believe that they are also entertainers, because they have ability to rule people into whatever that they are doing. So I believe that they do have a chance to become a good politicians. You know, they have the influence. Yes, they do. They have the influence, but the different type of influence. Like, for instance, musicians. Some of them are, like, beefing and stuff like that. So, like, obviously people are gonna be, like, scared and, you know But I also feel that if that's directed into the right direction, that beefing, it can actually do good for them as politicians, you know, because for you as well, I believe that if you're given a chance in something, you will be able to do it. Don't you think so? Yes, you can. But we have more experienced people to do politics. The celebrities don't, do not have the experience, and most of them are greedy, So. Politicians are greedy? Yes. Politicians are also greedy, man, you know? Yeah. So I believe that anyone can be whatever they want to be if they are presented with an opportunity, if the opportunity comes their way, you know, I can also become a politician if I want to. It is possible, you know? It is, with the experience that they have and with the experience that they can be given too. Because in order for you to have experience in something, you need to practice that. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. So they can really, imagine. I don't want to say their names, but. But, okay, imagine this rapper. He has so, so many followers, you know? Imagine him being a politician. Oh, and then, yeah, they have, like, most of them have, like, cult fans. Like, cult, like fans. So, like, they could lead the country to the wrong direction because they have all the influence, so they can do whatever they want, not with the influence they have. They can do, like, wrong things and do disruption and all those type of things. And I feel like they have, if they do make wrong decisions, their fans, their followers will follow them, which means, it won't be a good It won't be a good party. Yeah. You know what? I feel that it has two sides. Yeah, it does. because like, yeah it does Yeah, it has two sides. So, yeah.",okay my name is pam fukin and i consent to recording this conversation my name is tom fukin and i consent to recording this conversation alright so our topic for today um is can celebrities

My name is Joy Muthoni and I consent to recording this conversation. [ Speaker 1]: Okay, Joy Muthoni, welcome to our today's session. I'm very humbled to be with you today. Welcome and to our first question, or we are discussing about rising fuel prices. Kindly let us know an overview of what is rising fuel prices. Once again, thank you, Mister Francis, for having me. Well, rising fuel prices refers to the increase in cost of gasoline, diesel and other fossil fuels used as source of energy. This phenomenon can occur due to a variety of factors such as global supply and demand, political instability, natural disasters, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As fuel prices continue to rise, it can have a significant impact on the economy, transportation, and the cost of living for individuals and businesses. Measures such as conservation efforts and exploring alternative energy sources are often implemented to address the effects of rising fuel prices. And that I believe we have understood each other up to that point. Now, have you noticed how the fuel prices have been rising lately? Yes, actually I've noticed that. And it's crazy how much it costs to fill up a tank these days. Okay, I heard that fuel prices are expected to go even higher. How do you think this will affect people's daily routines and expenses? First of all, the price of crude oil will go up and we know that this is the largest single component in the price of diesel fuel. Crude oil prices are. Crude oil prices are volatile and they can fluctuate significantly any time. Now, we have taxes. Taxes are another crucial factor in determining fuel prices. Many countries impose taxes such as excise taxes and value added taxes on fuel prices. Another one we have distribution, distribution and marketing cost. Once the fuel has been refined, it needs to reach the end consumer. The cost associated with the distribution becomes very high. We have the other one. We have a refining cost. Oil needs to be refined into gasoline before it can be used by consumers, which is why refining costs are factored into the price of gas. We have exchange rates, Mister Francis. On this one, oil is often traded in United States dollars. Therefore, currency exchange rates can affect fuel prices. A depreciation of a country's local currency can make the imported ones go very high. We have geopolitics. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as geopolitical tensions or natural disasters. When the price of crude oil increases, it becomes more expensive. We have fuel. Natural gas prices are affected by market supply and demand. US natural gas production increased in recent years. Economic growth can affect natural gas in a very big way. We have energy policy. In this one, fuel prices influence energy policy decisions as governments may implement measures to encourage energy conservation and reduce dependence. And we also have disasters when it comes to disasters, natural disasters can cause crude oil to. to fluctuate by affecting the oil supply. Now we have market speculation. Speculative trading in the commodities market can lead to price volatility in the oil markets. Australia's respond to perceived supply and demand. We have supply, Mister Francis, supply has an effect on price. Supply is usually kept slightly below demand by about 1 million barrels per day. Now, we have demand rather transport. Mister Francis. On this one, transportation costs affect prices and generally increase based on the distance between the retail location and the sources of supply. We have demand. When demand for diesel is high, prices tend to increase. This is because there is more competition for the limited supply of diesel in the demands and we have weather. Natural disasters like hurricanes can disrupt refining operations leading to shortages which drive up gas prices. We have demand for oil. Supply and demand for crude oil refinery production and capacity. The pound to dollar exchange rate as refined fuel is sold in the US dollars. And we have factors that affect gas prices. Gasoline prices are one of the most recognizable prices points in the American commerce. Nearly 40 million Americans fill up the gases. We have seasonal demand. On this one, seasonal changes greatly influence crude oil prices. For example, prices tend to rise in August when people travel and demand gasoline more. We have economic growth. During periods of economic growth increased, rather increased demand for goods and services from the commercial and industrial sectors may increase natural gas consumption. That's all for today Mister Francis. Do you think you have any other factor or you have exhausted or? Oh nice. We also have OPEC. The difference between oil market demand and supply from non OPEC sources is often referred to as the call on OPEC because OPEC members maintain the world's oil prices. We have taxes. On this, the federal, state, county and the local government. The relative share of these components in the retail price of a gallon of diesel fuel varies over time.

My name is Marci Muomo and I consent to recording this conversation. Thank you, Marcy, for showing up today for this program, and you are welcome. I am so humbled to join you today. Thank you, Marcy. Today we are starting with some several questions that I have concerning pandemics. The question I will be asking is, what is a pandemic? Thank you once again. Pandemic or pandemics, refer to global or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread across multiple countries or continents, affecting a large number of people. These diseases can spread quickly and commonly have a high mortality rate. History has shown that pandemics can have devastating effects on human populations, causing millions of deaths and disrupting societies and economies. Previous pandemics include the Black Death, Spanish flu, and HIV and AIDS. The current Covid-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, has impacted the world in unprecedented ways and serves as a reminder of the ongoing threat of widespread diseases. Governments, organizations, and individuals must work together to prevent and mitigate the effects of pandemics through measures such as vaccinations, public health interventions, and international cooperations. Thank you so much, Masi, for the good introduction. The second question goes now, have you been following the news on the latest pandemic outbreak? Yes, I've been following up, and it's very saddening. Well, what do you think about the measures being taken to contain it? Well, keep yourself and others safe at all times. Protect yourself and those around you. Get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn, and follow local guidance and vaccination. Keep physical distance of at least 1 meter from others, even if they don't appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact. Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings. Clean your hands frequently with alcohol based hand rub or soap and water. Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissue immediately and clean hands regularly if you develop symptoms or test positive for Covid-19 self isolate until you recover, I think it's better I explain further about the guidelines, and as I had stated earlier, I will have to explain further so that we keep ourselves and the ones we love safe. So when it comes to wearing your mask, here are my thoughts about it. Make sure that your mask covers your nose, mouth, and chinook. Clear your hands or rather, clean your hands before you put your mask on, and after you take it off and after you touch it at any time. Make your environment safer. That is our next point. The risk of getting Covid-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces. Infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. Outbreaks have been reported in places where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings and where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing, such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship. Also keep good hygiene. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you, also the people you love, from viruses that cause colds, flu and Covid-19. And to ensure good hygiene, you should always regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with either an alcohol based hand wrap or soap in water. This eliminates germs that may be on your hands, including viruses. Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens. To do when you don't feel well. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by telephone first and follow the directions of your local health authority. Also know the full range of symptoms of Covid-19 the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, dry cough, tiredness and loss of taste or smell. Less common symptoms include aches and pains, headache, sore throat, red or irritated eyes, diarrhea, a skin rash or discoloration of fingers or toes. Stay home and self isolate for ten days from symptoms onset plus three days after symptoms cease. Keep up to date on the latest information from the trusted sources such as World Health Organizations or your local and national health authorities. Local and national authorities and public health units are the best placed to advise, or rather the best places to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves. That's so educative. And to the next question. Do you remember the last pandemic that happened? How did it impact your daily life. And routine and the recent pandemic? And that is, Covid-19 is the one that I'll be addressing because it's the one that affected me the most. And I will have to categorize the affected areas into various categories we have on the healthcare sector, on the healthcare center. As I stated, these are the challenges that we really encountered. Challenges in the diagnosis, quarantine and treatment of suspected or confirmed cases. High burden of the functioning of the existing medical system. Patients with other disease and health problems are getting neglected overload on doctors and other healthcare professionals who are at a very high risk. Overloading of medical shops, requirement for high protection, disruption of medical supply chain and when it came to economic there is the slowing of the manufacturing of essential goods, disrupt of the supply chain of products, losses in national and international businesses, poor cash flow in the market significant slowing down in the revenue growth when it came to social service sector is not being able to provide their proper service. Cancellation of postponed or postponement of large scale sports and tournaments avoiding the national and international traveling and cancellation of services disruption of celebration of cultural, religious and festive events undue stress among the population, social distancing with our peers and family members closure of the hotels, restaurants and religious places. Now Covid-19 has affected the sources of supply and effects rather affects the global economy. There are restrictions of traveling from one country to another during traveling. Number of cases are identified positive when tested. Now let me remind all of you, make sure you protect yourself and protect those who love you. Thank you so much. That was so informative and thank you for coming through. Mercy. That was very, very excellent. I'm so humbled to having me on this platform to make people aware of Covid-19 thank you so much.",my name is francis and i consent to record in this conversation my name is mursim and i consent to

name is marci muomo and i consent to recording this conversation. thank you, marcy, for showing up today for this program, and you are welcome. i am so humbled to join you today. thank you, marcy. today we are starting with some several questions that i have concerning pandemics. the question i will be asking is, what is a pandemic? thank you once again. pandemic or pandemics, refer to global or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread across multiple countries or continents, affecting a large number of people. these diseases can spread quickly and commonly have a high mortality rate. history has shown that pandemics can have devastating effects on human populations, causing millions of deaths and disrupting societies and economies. previous pandemics include the black death, spanish flu, and hiv and aids. the current covid-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, has impacted the world in unprecedented ways and serves as a reminder of the ongoing threat of widespread diseases. governments, organizations, and individuals must work together to prevent and mitigate the effects of pandemics through measures such as vaccinations, public health interventions, and international cooperations. thank you so much, masi, for the good introduction. the second question goes now, have you been following the news on the latest pandemic outbreak? yes, i've been following up, and it's very saddening. well, what do you think about the measures being taken to contain it? well, keep yourself and others safe at all times. protect yourself and those around you. get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn, and follow local guidance and vaccination. keep physical distance of at least 1 meter from others, even if they don't appear to be sick. avoid crowds and close contact. wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings. clean your hands frequently with alcohol based hand rub or soap and water. cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. dispose of used tissue immediately and clean hands regularly if you develop symptoms or test positive for covid-19 self isolate until you recover, i think it's better i explain further about the guidelines, and as i had stated earlier, i will have to explain further so that we keep ourselves and the ones we love safe. so when it comes to wearing your mask, here are my thoughts about it. make sure that your mask covers your nose, mouth, and chinook. clear your hands or rather, clean your hands before you put your mask on, and after you take it off and after you touch it at any time. make your environment safer. that is our next point. the risk of getting covid-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces. infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. outbreaks have been reported in places where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings and where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing, such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship. also keep good hygiene. by following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you, also the people you love, from viruses that cause colds, flu and covid-19. and to ensure good hygiene, you should always regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with either an alcohol based hand wrap or soap in water. this eliminates germs that may be on your hands, including viruses. cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens. to do when you don't feel well. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. call by telephone first and follow the directions of your local health authority. also know the full range of symptoms of covid-19 the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, dry cough, tiredness and loss of taste or smell. less common symptoms include aches and pains, headache, sore throat, red or irritated eyes, diarrhea, a skin rash or discoloration of fingers or toes. stay home and self isolate for ten days from symptoms onset plus three days after symptoms cease. keep up to date on the latest information from the trusted sources such as world health organizations or your local and national health authorities. local and national authorities and public health units are the best placed to advise, or rather the best places to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves. that's so educative. and to the next question. do you remember the last pandemic that happened? how did it impact your daily life. and routine and the recent pandemic? and that is, covid-19 is the one that i'll be addressing because it's the one that affected me the most. and i will have to categorize the affected areas into various categories we have on the healthcare sector, on the healthcare center. as i stated, these are the challenges that we really encountered. challenges in the diagnosis, quarantine and treatment of suspected or confirmed cases. high burden of the functioning of the existing medical system. patients with other disease and health problems are getting neglected overload on doctors and other healthcare professionals who are at a very high risk. overloading of medical shops, requirement for high protection, disruption of medical supply chain and when it came to economic there is the slowing of the manufacturing of essential goods, disrupt of the supply chain of products, losses in national and international businesses, poor cash flow in the market significant slowing down in the revenue growth when it came to social service sector is not being able to provide their proper service. cancellation of postponed or postponement of large scale sports and tournaments avoiding the national and international traveling and cancellation of services disruption of celebration of cultural, religious and festive events undue stress among the population, social distancing with our peers and family members closure of the hotels, restaurants and religious places. now covid-19 has affected the sources of supply and effects rather affects the global economy. there are restrictions of traveling from one country to another during traveling. number of cases are identified positive when tested. now let me remind all of you, make sure you protect yourself and protect those who love you. thank you so much. that was so informative and thank you for coming through. mercy. that was very, very excellent. i'm so humbled to having me on this platform to make people aware of covid-19 thank you so much.",0.2206405693950178,my name is francis and i consent to record in this conversation my name is mursim and i

My name is Ruth Miner and I consent to recording this conversation. Welcome, Ruth, to this, to today's program and thank you for coming and being here with me. Thank you for having me. Welcome. So on to our first question. And before I proceed to the first question, the topic of the day today is day school versus boarding school. Can you kindly let me know the difference between a day school and a boarding school? Once again, thank you very much for having me. I will proceed by explaining what the two of them means. Day school and boarding school are two different educational systems that cater to students at different stages of their academic journey. Day school, also known as traditional schooling, involves students attending classes during the day and returning home in the evening. On the other hand, boarding schools provide students with a residential option where they stay on campus and receive both academic and extracurricular instructions. While day school offers students the comfort of living at home, boarding school provides a more immersive learning experience with 24/7 access to the facilities and resources. Both school options have their advantages and disadvantages. Thank you so much, Ruth, for that explanation and I'm very satisfied. Now let's go to the first question of the day. So have you ever attended a boarding school before? I'm curious how it compares to traditional day schools. Yes, actually I've been to boarding schools all my primary level, high school level and my campus level. And your question was how do the both of them compare? First of all, we have independence. Life has many highs and lows. The best way to learn how to cope and thrive in whatever the circumstance lies in making decisions for yourself and becoming self reliant. It can be a tough experience at first, but with time this independence will make you more confident and mature. A boarding school environment gives greater room for students to develop independent skills in a supportive environment. It also enables you to learn how to live more comfortable with people of different backgrounds, an ability that will be useful when students become adults and have to live, study and work on their own. Now on to the second one. We have responsibility. Without parents constantly monitoring students, they also learn how to take personal responsibility for themselves. From managing money to keeping their dorm space tidy. They encounter many situations where they have to think of actions and consequences. This again helps them to become more mature and able to succeed in future. Now, when they have no supervision at all, they can be able to do all that without anyone following them. Learning to take responsibility for themselves will mold them into well rounded individuals better able to succeed in life. The third one we have life and soft skills. When we think of school, lots of the classroom books and labs come to mind. Boarding school, however, provide a more holistic education beyond books. Since students get to spend entire days at a stretch with classmates in and out of the classroom, they often build stronger ties and social networks, not forgetting friendship among themselves. Another comparison is that there is individual attention. Boarding schools tend to have much smaller classrooms. This means teachers can pay greater attention to the needs and performance of individual students, helping them to discover their strengths and weaknesses. This greater individual attention ensures shortcomings are identified and addressed early so that students perform better academically and have a better chance of gaining admission to the universities of their choice. This deeper interaction between the teachers and the students ensure better mentorship and stronger communication whereby students learn to become more at ease speaking up in the classroom and engaging in discussion. This mostly happened to me. I was really in a position to ask questions because there was a time I was not in that position, but due to the interaction with the teachers and the students, I gained even more courage to ask questions during lesson time where I never understood properly. Another comparison is networking. Having to live, study and play together. It encourages deeper bonds between students. The friendships they make will often be lasting and carry and or rather can carry on to the time they enter university and later build their careers. Many boarding schools host a multicultural student body that give opportunities to explore cultural differences and learn how to appreciate diversity. Many boarding schools are highly selective of the students they admit they choose that they demonstrate strong potential and ambition to make achievements. Another one we have the academic rigor. Boarding schools make for a more intense academic life. There is greater investment in the required support systems including highly qualified teachers, well equipped laboratories, well stocked libraries, media centers and other technologies. Teachers design lessons and apply teaching modalities that make for more challenging learning that boost critical thinking and problem solving. Another one we have learning focus. Intellectual stimulation is quite high in boarding school environment. There is better recognition and nurturing of academic prowess causing students to be highly motivated. This stimulation comes from both teachers and fellow students who create an atmosphere both in and out of the classroom where there is an emphasis on academic achievement and we have co curricular activities. Most boarding schools have also heavily invested in their arts programs and sporting facilities. Students with an interest or talent in co curricular activities will certainly find a niche they can explore and be trained in. Sports team will often compete with other schools providing opportunities to bring recognition to the school and their personal achievement on the field. This success can also help to enhance their applications to universities and where they have excels provide a chance to secure scholarships. We have convenience. Boarding schools means no morning or after school commute for parents and students, there is more time that can be devoted to studying and co curricular activities in a safe and controlled environment. For parents that often have to travel, it is a comfort to know that their child is well catered to in a learning environment tailored to help them succeed in their ambitions. Last but not least, we have meaningful reunion. Absence makes the heart grow fonder in clearly proven where it comes to boarding schools. The joy that students and their families feel at being reunited over holiday periods is very strong. Actually, plans are more often made to make these reunions more meaningful by organizing trips and other activities where there's more interaction and much fun to be had. This can serve to strengthen family bonds in spite of the separation. Wow. The second question is I've been considering sending my child to a boarding school, but I'm not sure if it's the right choice. Have you ever had any experiences with it? Speaker 2: With the experience that I gained, actually, sending your child to a boarding school is something that you cannot regret as a parent. First of all, cost of education. Almost all parents are aware that boarding schools are more expensive than day schools, but few are aware of the reasons why. Because in a day school, students attend class only during designated times. They go to class, finish up and then head home. But boarding schools students, with the exception of their breaks, they spend their whole time on campus and in this place. Rather in this place, the cost difference exists owing to the supply of services such as lodging, meals, health security measures, school stationery and so on. Another thing to consider is self sufficiency and self assurance. Children who study in boarding school atmosphere complete all of their responsibilities. They learn to provide for themselves since they must complete their tasks without the assistance of others. They address their everyday difficulties and attend their requirements such as purchasing essential items when they run out of them or ensuring that their school uniforms are cleaned and pressed. As a result, they grow more self sufficient, disciplined and autonomous. Also constant guidance. Only some youngsters have the same gripping ability. While some kids pick up on topics quickly, others require more time to comprehend. Teachers at a day school are only accessible for limited time and pupils may not have enough opportunity to put their concerns since teachers are only available for a limited time, which make you, which helps you even to consider more taking your child to a boarding school. We have physical fitness. By stressing the component of physical fitness both day school and boarding school include athletics as part of their curriculum. However, many boarding institutions have the extra benefit of putting a focus on physical health. Students spend more time playing games which lead to improved physical condition. This keeps them healthy both physically and emotionally. Additionally, involvement in school sports programs benefit kids chances of getting into college, expanding their range of employment options, and generally improving the quality of life. We have development on all levels. Academic success used to be the main goal, with sports and extracurricular activities being overlooked, but with increased competition, children are expected to excel in various fields of study, expression, athletics, theatre, singing, dancing and so on. Day schools include extracurricular activities, but pupils are unable to take advantage of them owing to a lack of time. However, boarding school students are free to spend their time participating in a variety of extracurricular activities throughout the day. This provides kids with a better platform to discover themselves and their abilities. We have safety, care and monitoring. One of the primary worries of the of parents is their child's safety. Both day school and boarding schools stress student safety, but boarding schools goes above and beyond since they are solely responsible for the children. Most boarding schools adopt safety and monitoring procedures that make use of modern technology to accomplish this. We also have, and sorry we have compared to typical schools, these employ a greater number of security professionals. And my final words are this. With so many benefits and chances available, boarding schools turn out to be the best decision for both parents and children, which is why many parents prefer them over day schools. That was so excellent from you, Ruth. Thank you for coming and thank you for participating in this program. I'm so grateful for having me and thank you so much for your time also.

kindly let me know the difference between day school and a boarding school again thank you very much for having me i will proceed by explaining what the two of them means school and boarding school are two different educational systems that cater to students at different stages of their academic journey day school also known as traditional schooling involves student attending classes during the day and returning home in the evening on the other hand boarding schools provide students with a residential option where they stay on campus and receive both academic and extracurricular instructions while day school offers students the comfort of living at home boarding school provides a more immersive learning experience with twenty four seven access to the facilities and resources both school options have their advantages and disadvantages thank you so much ruth for that explanation and very satisfied now let's go to the first question of the day so before i'm curious how it compares to traditional day schools actually i've been to schools my primary level high school level and my campus level and your question was how do the both of them compare first of all we have independence life has many highs and lows the best way to learn how to cope and drive in whatever the circumstance lies in making decisions for yourself and becoming self reliant it can be a tough experience at first but with time this independence will make you more confident and mature a building school environment gives greater room for students to develop independent skills in a supportive environment it also enables you to learn how to live more comfortably with people of different backgrounds an ability that will be useful when students become adults and have to live study and work on your own now on to the second one we have responsibility without parents constantly monitoring students they also learn how to take personal responsibility for themselves from managing money to keeping their dorm space tidy they encounter many situations where they have to think of action and consequences this again helps them to become more mature and able to succeed in future now when they have no supervision at all they can be able to do all that without anyone following them learning to take responsibility for themselves will mould them well rounded individuals better able to succeed in life we have life life and soft skills when we think of school thoughts of the classroom books and labs come to mind boarding school however provide a more holistic education beyond books since students get to spend entire days at a stretch with classmates in and out of the classroom they often build stronger ties and social networks not forgetting friendship among themselves another comparison is that there is individual attention boarding schools tend to have much smaller classrooms this means teachers can pay greater attention to the needs and performance of individual students helping them to discover their strength and weaknesses this greater individual attention ensures shortcomings are identified and addressed early so that students perform better academically and have a better chance of gaining admission to the universities of their choice this deeper interaction between the teachers and the students ensure better mentorship and stronger communication whereby students learn to become more at ease picking up in the classroom and engaging in discussion this mostly happened to me i was really in a position to ask questions because there was a time i was not in that position but due to the interaction with teachers and their students i gain even more courage to ask questions during lesson time where i never understood properly another comparison is networking having to live study and play together it encourages bonds between students the friendships they make will often be lasting and carry and or rather can carry on to the time they enter university and later build their careers many boarding schools host a multicultural student body that give opportunities to explore cultural differences and learn and learn how to appreciate diversity many boarding school of the students the admit they choose that they demonstrate strong potential and mission to make achievements another one we have the academic rigor boarding schools make for a more intense academic life this greater investment in the required support systems including highly qualified teachers well equipped laboratories well stocked libraries media centers and other technologies teachers design lessons and apply teaching modalities that make for more challenging learning that boost critical thinking and problem solving another one is learning focus intellectual stimulation is quite high in building school environment there's better recognition and nurturing of academic causing students to be highly motivated this stimulation comes from both teachers and fellow students who create an atmosphere both in and out of the classroom where there is an emphasis on academic achievement and we have co curricular activities most boarding schools also heavily invested in their arts programs and sporting facilities students with an interest or talents in co curricular activities will certainly find a niche they can explore and be trained in sports teams will often compete with other schools providing opportunities to bring recognition to the school and their personal achievement on the field this success can also help to enhance their application to universities and where they have excels provide a chance to secure a scholarship we have convenience boarding schools means no morning or after school commute for parents and there's more time that can be devoted to studying and co curricular activities in a safe and controlled environment for parents that often have to travel it is a comfort to know that their child is well catered to in a learning environment tailored to help them succeed in their missions last but not least we have meaningful reunion absence makes the heart grow fonder and clearly proven where it comes to boarding schools the joy that students and their families feel at being reunited over holiday periods is very strong actually plants are more often made to make these reunions more meaningful by organizing trips and other activities where there is more interaction and much fun to be had this can serve to strengthen family bonds in spite of their separation well the second question is i've been considering sending my child to a boarding school but i'm not sure if it's the right choice any experiences with the experience that i gained actually sending your child to a boarding school is something that you cannot regret as a parent first of all cost of education almost all parents are aware that boarding schools are more expensive than these schools but few are aware of the reasons why because in a day school students attend class only during designated times they go to class finish up and then head home but boarding schools students with the exception of their breaks they spend their whole time on campus and in this place rather in this place the cost difference exists owing to the supply of services such as lodging meals health security measures school stationery so on another thing to consider self sufficiency and self assurance children who study in building school atmosphere complete all of their responsibilities they learn to provide for themselves since they must complete their tasks without the assistance of others they address everyday difficulties and attend their requirements such as purchasing essential items when they run out of them or ensuring that their school uniforms are cleaned and pressed as a result they grow more self sufficient disciplined and autonomous also constant guidance only some youngsters have the same griping ability while some kids pick up on topics quickly others require more time to comprehend teachers at a day school are only accessible for a limited time and pupils may not have enough opportunity to their concerns since teachers are only available for a limited time which make you which helps you even to consider more taking your child to a boarding school we have physical fitness by stressing the component of physical fitness both day school and boarding school athletics as part of their curriculum however many boarding institutions have the extra benefit of putting a focus on physical health students spend more time playing games which lead to improved physical condition this keep them healthy both physically and emotionally additionally involvement in school sports programs benefit kids chances of getting into college expanding their range of employment options and generally improving the quality of life we have development on all levels academic success used to be the main goal with sports and curricular activities being overlooked but with increased competition children are expected to excel in various fields of study expression athletics theater singing dancing and so on these schools include extracurricular activities but pupils are unable to take advantage of them owing to a lack of time however boarding school students are free to spend their time participating in a variety of extracurricular activities throughout the day this provide kids with a better platform to discover themselves and their abilities we have safety care and one of the primary worries of parents is their child's safety both the school and boarding schools stress student safety but boarding schools goes above and beyond since they are solely responsible for the children most boarding schools adopt safety and monitoring procedures that make use of modern technology to accomplish things we also have sorry we have compared to typical schools these employ a greater number of security professionals and my final words are this with so many benefits and chances available boarding schools turn out to be the decision for both parents and children which is why many parents prefer them over these calls that was so excellent from you thank you for coming and thank you for participating in this program i'm so grateful for having me and thank you so much for your time also you're welcome,my name is francis

benefits and chances available boarding schools turn out to be the decision for both parents and children which is why many parents prefer them over these calls that was so excellent from you thank you for coming and thank you for participating in this program i'm so grateful for having me and thank you so much for your time also you're welcome,"my name is francis vundi and i consent to recording this conversation. my name is ruth miner and i consent to recording this conversation. welcome, ruth, to this, to today's program and thank you for coming and being here with me. thank you for having me. welcome. so on to our first question. and before i proceed to the first question, the topic of the day today is day school versus boarding school. can you kindly let me know the difference between a day school and a boarding school? once again, thank you very much for having me. i will proceed by explaining what the two of them means. day school and boarding school are two different educational systems that cater to students at different stages of their academic journey. day school, also known as traditional schooling, involves students attending classes during the day and returning home in the evening. on the other hand, boarding schools provide students with a residential option where they stay on campus and receive both academic and extracurricular instructions. while day school offers students the comfort of living at home, boarding school provides a more immersive learning experience with 24/7 access to the facilities and resources. both school options have their advantages and disadvantages. thank you so much, ruth, for that explanation and i'm very satisfied. now let's go to the first question of the day. so have you ever attended a boarding school before? i'm curious how it compares to traditional day schools. yes, actually i've been to boarding schools all my primary level, high school level and my campus level. and your question was how do the both of them compare? first of all, we have independence. life has many highs and lows. the best way to learn how to cope and thrive in whatever the circumstance lies in making decisions for yourself and becoming self reliant. it can be a tough experience at first, but with time this independence will make you more confident and mature. a boarding school environment gives greater room for students to develop independent skills in a supportive environment. it also enables you to learn how to live more comfortable with people of different backgrounds, an ability that will be useful when students become adults and have to live, study and work on their own. now on to the second one. we have responsibility. without parents constantly monitoring students, they also learn how to take personal responsibility for themselves. from managing money to keeping their dorm space tidy. they encounter many situations where they have to think of actions and consequences. this again helps them to become more mature and able to succeed in future. now, when they have no supervision at all, they can be able to do all that without anyone following them. learning to take responsibility for themselves will mold them into well rounded individuals better able to succeed in life. the third one we have life and soft skills. when we think of school, lots of the classroom books and labs come to mind. boarding school, however, provide a more holistic education beyond books. since students get to spend entire days at a stretch with classmates in and out of the classroom, they often build stronger ties and social networks, not forgetting friendship among themselves. another comparison is that there is individual attention. boarding schools tend to have much smaller classrooms. this means teachers can pay greater attention to the needs and performance of individual students, helping them to discover their strengths and weaknesses. this greater individual attention ensures shortcomings are identified and addressed early so that students perform better academically and have a better chance of gaining admission to the universities of their choice. this deeper interaction between the teachers and the students ensure better mentorship and stronger communication whereby students learn to become more at ease speaking up in the classroom and engaging in discussion. this mostly happened to me. i was really in a position to ask questions because there was a time i was not in that position, but due to the interaction with the teachers and the students, i gained even more courage to ask questions during lesson time where i never understood properly. another comparison is networking. having to live, study and play together. it encourages deeper bonds between students. the friendships they make will often be lasting and carry and or rather can carry on to the time they enter university and later build their careers. many boarding schools host a multicultural student body that give opportunities to explore cultural differences and learn how to appreciate diversity. many boarding schools are highly selective of the students they admit they choose that they demonstrate strong potential and ambition to make achievements. another one we have the academic rigor. boarding schools make for a more intense academic life. there is greater investment in the required support systems including highly qualified teachers, well equipped laboratories, well stocked libraries, media centers and other technologies. teachers design lessons and apply teaching modalities that make for more challenging learning that boost critical thinking and problem solving. another one we have learning focus. intellectual stimulation is quite high in boarding school environment. there is better recognition and nurturing of academic prowess causing students to be highly motivated. this stimulation comes from both teachers and fellow students who create an atmosphere both in and out of the classroom where there is an emphasis on academic achievement and we have co curricular activities. most boarding schools have also heavily invested in their arts programs and sporting facilities. students with an interest or talent in co curricular activities will certainly find a niche they can explore and be trained in. sports team will often compete with other schools providing opportunities to bring recognition to the school and their personal achievement on the field. this success can also help to enhance their applications to universities and where they have excels provide a chance to secure scholarships. we have convenience. boarding schools means no morning or after school commute for parents and students, there is more time that can be devoted to studying and co curricular activities in a safe and controlled environment. for parents that often have to travel, it is a comfort to know that their child is well catered to in a learning environment tailored to help them succeed in their ambitions. last but not least, we have meaningful reunion. absence makes the heart grow fonder in clearly proven where it comes to boarding schools. the joy that students and their families feel at being reunited over holiday periods is very strong. actually, plans are more often made to make these reunions more meaningful by organizing trips and other activities where there's more interaction and much fun to be had. this can serve to strengthen family bonds in spite of the separation. wow. the second question is i've been considering sending my child to a boarding school, but i'm not sure if it's the right choice. have you ever had any experiences with it? speaker 2: with the experience that i gained, actually, sending your child to a boarding school is something that you cannot regret as a parent. first of all, cost of education. almost all parents are aware that boarding schools are more expensive than day schools, but few are aware of the reasons why. because in a day school, students attend class only during designated times. they go to class, finish up and then head home. but boarding schools students, with the exception of their breaks, they spend their whole time on campus and in this place. rather in this place, the cost difference exists owing to the supply of services such as lodging, meals, health security measures, school stationery and so on. another thing to consider is self sufficiency and self assurance. children who study in boarding school atmosphere complete all of their responsibilities. they learn to provide for themselves since they must complete their tasks without the assistance of others. they address their everyday difficulties and attend their requirements such as purchasing essential items when they run out of them or ensuring that their school uniforms are cleaned and pressed. as a result, they grow more self sufficient, disciplined and autonomous. also constant guidance. only some youngsters have the same gripping ability. while some kids pick up on topics quickly, others require more time to comprehend. teachers at a day school are only accessible for limited time and pupils may not have enough opportunity to put their concerns since teachers are only available for a limited time, which make you, which helps you even to consider more taking your child to a boarding school. we have physical fitness. by stressing the component of physical fitness both day school and boarding school include athletics as part of their curriculum. however, many boarding institutions have the extra benefit of putting a focus on physical health. students spend more time playing games which lead to improved physical condition. this keeps them healthy both physically and emotionally. additionally, involvement in school sports programs benefit kids chances of getting into college, expanding their range of employment options, and generally improving the quality of life. we have development on all levels. academic success used to be the main goal, with sports and extracurricular activities being overlooked, but with increased competition, children are expected to excel in various fields of study, expression, athletics, theatre, singing, dancing and so on. day schools include extracurricular activities, but pupils are unable to take advantage of them owing to a lack of time. however, boarding school students are free to spend their time participating in a variety of extracurricular activities throughout the day. this provides kids with a better platform to discover themselves and their abilities. we have safety, care and monitoring. one of the primary worries of the of parents is their child's safety. both day school and boarding schools stress student safety, but boarding schools goes above and beyond since they are solely responsible for the children. most boarding schools adopt safety and monitoring procedures that make use of modern technology to accomplish this. we also have, and sorry we have compared to typical schools, these employ a greater number of security professionals. and my final words are this. with so many benefits and chances available, boarding schools turn out to be the best decision for both parents and children, which is why many parents prefer them over day schools. that was so excellent from you, ruth. thank you for coming and thank you for participating in this program. i'm so grateful for having me and thank you so much for your time also. you are welcome.",0.15836597649692222,my name is

also enables you to learn how to live more comfortable with people of different backgrounds an ability that will be useful when students become adults and have to live study and work on their own now on to the 2nd one we have responsibility without parents constantly monitoring students they also learn how to take personal responsibility for themselves from managing money to keeping their dorm space tidy they encounter many situations where they have to think of actions and consequences this again helps them to become more mature and able to succeed in future now when they have no supervision at all they can be able to do all that without anyone following them learning to take responsibility for themselves will mold them into well rounded individuals better able to succeed in life the 3rd one we have life and soft skills when we think of school lots of the classroom books and labs come to mind boarding school however provide a more holistic education beyond books since students get to spend entire days at a stretch with classmates in and out of the classroom they often build stronger ties and social networks not forgetting friendship among themselves another comparison is that there is individual attention boarding schools tend to have much smaller classrooms this means teachers can pay greater attention to the needs and performance of individual students helping them to discover their strengths and weaknesses this greater individual attention ensures shortcomings are identified and addressed early so that students perform better academically and have a better chance of gaining admission to the universities of their choice this deeper interaction between the teachers and the students ensure better mentorship and stronger communication whereby students learn to become more at ease speaking up in the classroom and engaging in discussion this mostly happened to me i was really in a position to ask questions because there was a time i was not in that position but due to the interaction with the teachers and the students i gained even more courage to ask questions during lesson time where i never understood properly another comparison is networking having to live study and play together it encourages deeper bonds between students the friendships they make will often be lasting and carry and or rather can carry on to the time they enter university and later build their careers many boarding schools host a multicultural student body that give opportunities to explore cultural differences and learn how to appreciate diversity many boarding schools are highly selective of the students they admit they choose that they demonstrate strong potential and ambition to make achievements another one we have the academic rigor boarding schools make for a more intense academic life there is greater investment in the required support systems including highly qualified teachers well equipped laboratories well stocked libraries media centers and other technologies teachers design lessons and apply teaching modalities that make for more challenging learning that boost critical thinking and problem solving another one we have learning focus intellectual stimulation is quite high in boarding school environment there is better recognition and nurturing of academic prowess causing students to be highly motivated this stimulation comes from both teachers and fellow students who create an atmosphere both in and out of the classroom where there is an emphasis on academic achievement and we have co curricular activities most boarding schools have also heavily invested in their arts programs and sporting facilities students with an interest or talent in co curricular activities will certainly find a niche they can explore and be trained in sports team will often compete with other schools providing opportunities to bring recognition to the school and their personal achievement on the field this success can also help to enhance their applications to universities and where they have excels provide a chance to secure scholarships we have convenience boarding schools means no morning or after school commute for parents and students there is more time that can be devoted to studying and co curricular activities in a safe and controlled environment for parents that often have to travel it is a comfort to know that their child is well catered to in a learning environment tailored to help them succeed in their ambitions last but not least we have meaningful reunion absence makes the heart grow fonder in clearly proven where it comes to boarding schools the joy that students and their families feel at being reunited over holiday periods is very strong actually plans are more often made to make these reunions more meaningful by organizing trips and other activities where there is more interaction and much fun to be had this can serve to strengthen family bonds in spite of the separation wow the 2nd question is i have been considering sending my child to a boarding school but i am not sure if it is the right choice have you ever had any experiences with it speaker 2 with the experience that i gained actually sending your child to a boarding school is something that you cannot regret as a parent 1st of all cost of education almost all parents are aware that boarding schools are more expensive than day schools but few are aware of the reasons why because in a day school students attend class only during designated times they go to class finish up and then head home but boarding schools students with the exception of their breaks they spend their whole time on campus and in this place rather in this place the cost difference exists owing to the supply of services such as lodging meals health security measures school stationery and so on another thing to consider is self sufficiency and self assurance children who study in boarding school atmosphere complete all of their responsibilities they learn to provide for themselves since they must complete their tasks without the assistance of others they address their everyday difficulties and attend their requirements such as purchasing essential items when they run out of them or ensuring that their school uniforms are cleaned and pressed as a result they grow more self sufficient disciplined and autonomous also constant guidance only some youngsters have the same gripping ability while some kids pick up on topics quickly others require more time to comprehend teachers at a day school are only accessible for limited time and pupils may not have enough opportunity to put their concerns since teachers are only available for a limited time which make you which helps you even to consider more taking your child to a boarding school we have physical fitness by stressing the component of physical fitness both day school and boarding school include athletics as part of their curriculum however many boarding institutions have the extra benefit of putting a focus on physical health students spend more time playing games which lead to improved physical condition this keeps them healthy both physically and emotionally additionally involvement in school sports programs benefit kids chances of getting into college expanding their range of employment options and generally improving the quality of life we have development on all levels academic success used to be the main goal with sports and extracurricular activities being overlooked but with increased competition children are expected to excel in various fields of study expression athletics theater singing dancing and so on day schools include extracurricular activities but pupils are unable to take advantage of them owing to a lack of time however boarding school students are free to spend their time participating in a variety of extracurricular activities throughout the day this provides kids with a better platform to discover themselves and their abilities we have safety care and monitoring one of the primary worries of the of parents is their child is safety both day school and boarding schools stress student safety but boarding schools goes above and beyond since they are solely responsible for the children most boarding schools adopt safety and monitoring procedures that make use of modern technology to accomplish this we also have and sorry we have compared to typical schools these employ a greater number of security professionals and my final words are this with so many benefits and chances available boarding schools turn out to be the best decision for both parents and children which is why many parents prefer them over day schools that was so excellent from you ruth thank you for coming and thank you for participating in this program i am so grateful for having me and thank you so much for your time also you are welcome
